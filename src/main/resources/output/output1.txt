PREFACE

Korean-as-a-foreign-language (KFL) teaching and learning in the English-
speaking world has hardly been popular among non-Koreans until quite 
recently. However, the number of KFL learners has started to grow rapidly 
since the latter half of the 1970s for various reasons, such as the increas-
ing visibility of South Korea on the international stage because of its fast 
economic development and its democratization over the last four decades, 
the continuing support from the Korean government regarding the expan-
sion of the Korean Studies program abroad, the growing importance of 
the North Korean issues in contemporary global-political affairs, and the 
recent growth of the Korean-American population in the USA.

In the USA alone, the number of colleges that offer KFL courses was 
merely ten in 1975. However, that number has grown to over 130 in the 
early 2000s. A few universities, including the University of Hawaii at Manoa 
and the University of California at Los Angeles, have offered Korean 
language BA, MA, and PhD programs. The number of Korean commu-
nity schools (for K-12 Korean and culture education) grew from seven in 
1975 to 832 in 1996, and to over 900 in the early 2000s. In addition, over 
20 public high schools have recently started to teach Korean. The Korean 
language boom is not confined within the US private sector or university 
settings but is found in the government sector as well. For example, US 
government institutes such as the Defense Language Institute, the Foreign 
Service Institute, and the Central Intelligence Agency provide intensive 
Korean language training.

In recent decades the number of KFL textbooks for English-speaking 
KFL classroom use has steadily increased. However, the number of KFL 
study materials intended for a self-study purpose is still relatively scarce. 
Furthermore, to date there has been no published KFL grammar workbook 
that specifically aims at providing supplemental grammar explanations and 
exercises in a single volume.

Basic Korean: A Grammar and Workbook and its sister volume, 
Intermediate Korean, are intended to meet that need. The book focuses on 
providing an accessible reference grammar explanation and related exercises 

9780415774871_A 01.indd   v ii9780415774871_A01.indd   vii 7/4/2008   1:43:04 PM7/4/2008   1:43:04 PM



in a single volume. It is designed for independent English-speaking adult 
KFL learners who intend to maintain and strengthen their knowledge of 
essential Korean grammar and for classroom-based learners who are look-
ing for supplemental grammar explanations and practices. Consequently, 
this book differs from existing KFL materials whose primary purpose is to 
help KFL learners acquire four language skills, such as listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing, as well as cultural knowledge.

The layout of this book also differs from those of existing KFL mater-
ials. For instance, a typical KFL textbook chapter may include model 
dialogues, followed by vocabulary lists, grammar explanations, cultural 
notes, and exercises. In contrast, following the pattern of other Grammar 
Workbooks of the Routledge series, every unit of Basic Korean focuses 
on presenting jargon-free and concise grammar explanations, followed by 
relevant grammar exercises.

This book has 25 units, and it does not take a functional-situational 
approach in grouping and/or sequencing target grammatical points. Rather 
it sequences and covers grammatical points according to their grammatical 
categories (e.g., nouns, pronouns, particles, numbers, verbs, adjectives, and 
so on), so that learners can use the book for reference material as well as 
for practice material. The exercises at the end of each unit are designed 
primarily to reinforce the target grammatical points.

All Korean entries are presented in Hangul (the Korean alphabet) with 
English translations to facilitate understanding. Accordingly, it requires 
that learners familiarize themselves with Hangul in Unit 1, before going 
on to the rest of the book. In addition, when translating Korean entries 
into English, efforts were made to reflect the Korean meaning as closely 
as possible. Consequently, some learners may feel certain English transla-
tions do not reflect typical English usages. However, the direct translation 
approach was employed for pedagogical purposes.

In writing this book, I have been fortunate to have the assistance 
and support of many people. I would like to thank my colleagues in 
the Department of East Asian Studies at the University at Albany, State 
University of New York, who were supportive of this project. I am grateful 
to anonymous reviewers for their constructive and valuable comments. 
I would like to express sincere gratitude to Sophie Oliver for initially 
encouraging this project and to the editorial and production teams at 
Routledge, Andrea Hartill, Ursula Mallows, Samantha Vale Noya, and 
Andrew Watts for their advice and support throughout the process. My 
thanks also go to Lisa Blackwell for her careful and thoughtful copy-editing. 
Finally, as always, my special thanks go to my wife, Isabel, who, with her 
optimism and encouragement, makes it possible for me to do what I really 
love to do. Of course, I bear all responsibility for any shortcomings and 
errors remaining.

UNIT 1
Reading Hangul (the Korean alphabet)

The Korean writing system “Hangul” is one of the most scientific and sys-
tematic writing systems in the world. Hangul is made of an alphabet of 21 
vowel and 19 consonant symbols. The system was invented in 1443 by the 
King Sejong the Great and his group of royal scholars during the Chosun 
dynasty of Korea (1392–1910). This unit introduces how to read Hangul. 
The unit introduces individual vowel and consonant symbols and discusses 
how each symbol is assembled into syllables to spell Korean words.

Vowels

Hangul has a total of 21 vowel symbols. Among them are 11 basic vowel 
and ten double-vowel symbols. The basic vowel symbols include:

 a (as in father)
 uh (as in uh-oh)
 o (as in home)
 oo (as in boo)
 u (as in pull)
 ee (as in feet)

 a (as in care)
 e (as in met)
 we (as in wet)
 wi (as in we are the world)
 ui (u as in pull, followed by ee as in feet, but said quickly as one 

sound).

Ten double-vowel symbols are made of either adding one more stroke to 
some of the above basic vowel symbols or combining some basic vowel 
symbols together. For instance, the following six double-vowel symbols 
are results of adding one more stroke (adding the y sound) to the first six 
vowel symbols above (e.g., adding a stroke to  “a,” you get  “ya”).

2  Unit 1: Reading Hangul

 ya (as in yard)
 yo (as in yonder)
 yo (as in yoga)
 yu (as in you)
 ya (as in yankie)

ye (as in yes)

Another four double-vowel symbols are made up of combining some 
of the basic vowel symbols together (e.g., combining  “o” and  “a” 
produces  “wa”):

 wa (as in wine)
 wo (as in wonder)
 wae (as in wait)
 whe (as in when)

Notice that the above four double-vowel symbols have the w sound.
You may wonder whether other vowel symbols can be combined. 

However, there are vowel symbols that cannot be combined together. 
For instance,  does not combine with  or , whereas  does not 
combine with  or . The reason is attributed to the Korean vowel 
harmony principle.

In Korean, two vowel symbols  and  are called “bright vowels” since 
they sound sonorous to Korean native speakers. Since the vowel symbols 
such as , , , and were derived from  and  (e.g., either add-
ing a stroke or combining them together), these vowel symbols are also 
considered “bright vowels.” On the other hand,  and  are considered 
“dark vowels” along with , , and . Meanwhile  and  are called 
“neutral vowels.” The vowel harmony principle prohibits the combination 
of bright and dark vowel symbols.

Consonants

Hangul has 19 consonant symbols, as shown below:

 p (as in park, but relaxed)
 p (as in pill, aspirated; or with puffs of air)
 p (as in speak, tense)

 t (as in tall, but relaxed)
 t (as in talk, aspirated)
 t (as in steam, tense)

 Unit 1: Reading Hangul  3

 k (as in kiss, but relaxed)
 k (as in king, aspirated)
 k (as in skill, tense)

 ch (as in chill, but relaxed)
 ch (as in change, aspirated)
 tch (as in midget, tense)

 m (as in mother)
 ng (as in king)

 n (as in nose)
 l (l as in lung or r as in Spanish r)
 h (as in hope)

 s (as in soul)
 s (as in sea)

How to combine consonant with vowel symbols

The basic unit of a Korean letter is a syllable. In other words, a complete 
Korean written letter must have at least one consonant and a vowel symbol. 
The combinations of the vowel and consonant symbols are fivefold.

First, a syllable consists of only one vowel sound (e.g., like English “a”). 
Although the letter pronunciation is consisted of only vowel pronunciation 
like “a” (without any spoken consonant), you still need to start the syllable 
with a consonant symbol to make the letter complete. For this purpose, you 
use a Korean consonant . The use of the  symbol is special in that it 
is used as zero-value consonant when it appears before a vowel. It func-
tions as a place holder in a word-initial position, so that the letter “a” 
should be written in Korean as  (not ). Let us take another example. 
Writing a letter for the sound “yo” should look like  not . Again, 
although the letter begins with the vowel pronunciation “yo” (without any 
spoken consonant), you still have to start with a zero-value consonant  
to make it a complete letter, as in .

Second, it can have a vowel but followed by a consonant (e.g., like 
English “on” or  in Korean). Third it can have a consonant, followed by 
a vowel (e.g., like English “go” or  in Korean). Fourth, a syllable letter 
can have a consonant, followed by a vowel, and then a consonant (e.g., 
like English “dam” or  in Korean) or two consonants (e.g., like English 
“host” or  in Korean).

The position of the vowel symbols is either to the right of or below the 
initial consonant symbol, as in  and . If the syllable has a consonant 
after a vowel symbol, it is always below the vowel, as in  and .

There are a few things to remember. First, a Korean syllable does not 
start with two consonants (e.g., unlike the English word “clip”). In addition, 

9780415774871_C 01.indd   39780415774871_C01.indd   3 7/4/2008   1:36:06 PM7/4/2008   1:36:06 PM



4  Unit 1: Reading Hangul

the syllable with three symbols (consonant-vowel-consonant(s)) seems to 
be more crowded and compacted than the one of two symbols (consonant-
vowel) formation. However, each syllable should look about the same size, 
no matter how many symbols it may contains. For instance, notice that the 
sizes of the following two letters are about the same:  and . Another 
thing to remember is that Hangul follows the spelling convention, and 
consequently, Korean spellings do not change just because it reads a little 
differently from its symbol combinations. In other words, one should not 
write just as each word sounds (this is the same for English, where you 
cannot write just as you hear or speak).

UNIT 2
Characteristics of the Korean language

Word order

English is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language (e.g., Andrew-studies-
Korean). However, Korean is a subject-object-verb (SOV) language (e.g., 

 “Andrew-Korean-studies”). In Korean, verbs 
and adjectives appear at the end of the sentence. All other elements such 
as nouns (e.g., subject and/or object), adverbs, and numbers, appear before 
verbs and/or adjectives. In addition, modifiers (e.g., adverbs, demonstrat-
ives, and relative clauses) appear before the modified words.

For instance, let us consider the following English sentence: “Peter 
studies history at the library in the afternoon.” We know that “Peter” is 
the subject since it comes before the verb “studies,” and “history” is the 
object as it appears after the verb. Notice that extra elements such as “at 
the library” and “in the afternoon” are placed after the object. In addition, 
English prepositions always appear before nouns, as in “at the library.”

However, the word order of Korean would be  
  “Peter library-at history studies.” Instead of English preposi-

tions, Korean has particles that always come after the noun. For instance, 
we know  is the subject, since it is marked by the subject particle 

 is the location since it is marked by the locative particle . In 
addition,  is the object, since it is marked by the object particle .

Consider another example:

    “Andrew eats lunch at home”

The subject particle  marks  as the subject of the sentence. The 
location particle  marks  as the location. In addition, the object 
particle  marks  as the object of the sentence.

Because of particles, Korean sentences do not always follow the SOV 
pattern. Korean nouns (as subjects or objects) can be freely arranged in 
a sentence. For instance, the following six sentences mean “Andrew eats 
lunch at home.”

9780415774871_C 02.indd   99780415774871_C02.indd   9 7/4/2008   1:35:22 PM7/4/2008   1:35:22 PM



10  Unit 2: Characteristics of the Korean language

    “Andrew home-at lunch eats”
    “Andrew lunch home-at eats”

    “Home-at Andrew lunch eats”
    “Home-at lunch Andrew eats”
    “Lunch Andrew home-at eats”
    “Lunch home-at Andrew eats”

The fact that Korean nouns can be freely arranged differs from English, 
since the English word order typically determines grammatical relation-
ships. The word order affects the Korean language only when certain 
particles are missing in given sentences (often during the colloquial 
usages).

Meanwhile, for delimiting the meaning of the nouns, the tone is often 
used in English. In Korean, however, the changing word orders (e.g., mov-
ing the important elements near the verb and less essential elements to 
the front of the sentence) or using the special particles (e.g., topic particle 

/ ) delimit the meanings of nouns.

Context-oriented language

In Korean the most important elements tend to cluster to the end of the 
sentence. The further the word is from the end of the sentence, the less 
important the element is and more likely it is to be dropped. In other 
words, what appears at the very end of the sentence (e.g., verbs) is most 
important. Consequently, Korean sentences that have no subject or object 
but just a verb or an adjective, such as in  “eat,” are grammatically 
correct and natural in conversation. Here are more examples.

 “How are you?”
are peaceful

 “What do you study?”
what study

 “Thank you”
thanks do

Notice that none of the above expressions contains the first or second 
person pronoun. What determines the omission is the context. The Korean 
language is a context-oriented language in that any contextually understood 
elements may be omitted unless they are indispensable.

 Unit 2: Characteristics of the Korean language  11

General-to-specific language

Korean is a “general-to-specific” or “big-to-small” language. In other 
words, Koreans write or say general, or bigger, units before the specific, 
or smaller, units. For instance, Koreans say or write the last name before 
the given name (e.g.,  “Kim Jungmin”).

When writing an address, they write the name of the country, followed 
by the province, city, street, house number, and the name of the receiver.

(Republic of Korea, Kyonggi Province, Seoul, Kumchon-District, Toksan 
113, Kim Jungmin)

When writing a date, the year comes first, followed by month and the 
day.

  (2007-year 8-month 5-day)

Honorific language

Korean is an honorific language in that it has grammatical elements that 
are used to indicate social meanings involved in contexts such as speakers’ 
attitudes (e.g., respect, humility, formality) toward who they are talking 
to or talking about.

For instance, Koreans use hierarchical address-reference terms of titles 
as well as various speech levels to indicate politeness, intimacy, and the 
formality level of discourse during interaction. In addition, they use humble 
person pronoun forms such as  “first person singular” and  “first 
person plural” to indicate humility. Moreover, Koreans use honorific 
suffix -( )  and euphemistic words to indicate respect toward a sub-
ject of higher social status. The following examples illustrate how Korean 
honorifics work:

(a) 
 “(I) appreciated that you came to our meeting yesterday.”
(b) 
 “(I) appreciated that you came to our meeting yesterday.”

As seen above, the referential meanings of the two sentences are the same. 
However, their social meanings are different. For example, in (a), the use 
of the plain first person pronoun, , the absence of the honorific suffix 
- , and the use of an intimate speech level -  indicate that the speaker 

9780415774871_C 02.indd   119780415774871_C02.indd   11 7/4/2008   1:35:22 PM7/4/2008   1:35:22 PM



12  Unit 2: Characteristics of the Korean language

is likely addressing a person either of equal (=power) or lower status 
(-power), and whom he/she knows well (-distance). Because it lacks proper 
honorific elements, the example in (a) would be rude in a formal situation 
if it was used by a lower-status person (e.g., a college student) addressing 
a higher-status person (e.g., a professor).

To make (a) socially appropriate in a +power situation (e.g., talking 
to someone of higher status), one should change , first person plural 
genitive pronoun, to , humble first person plural genitive pronoun, as 
shown in (b). In addition, one should add the honorific suffix -  to the 
gerundive verb  “giving (me)” making  thereby transforming it 
into an honorific verb, and use the deferential speech level sentence-ending 

 to change  “thanked (you)” to , in the deferen-
tial speech level. The above examples illustrate how the use of honorifics 
in Korean functions as a social indicator. In addition, they demonstrate 
that how an utterance is said is more important than what is said.

Exercises

Exercise 2.1

Circle whether the following statements are True or False.

Example: in English, prepositions always appear before nouns, as in 
 at home. (T / F)

1 In Korean, verbs and adjectives appear at the end of the sentence. 
(T / F)

2 In Korean, nouns, adverbs, and numbers, appear after verbs and/or 
adjectives. (T / F)

3 In Korean, what appears at the very beginning of the sentence is most 
important. (T / F)

4 In Korean, word order typically determines grammatical relationships. 
(T / F)

5 Instead of English prepositions, Korean has particles that always come 
before nouns. (T / F)

6 Korean sentences do not always follow the SOV pattern. (T / F)
7 Word order affects the Korean language only when certain particles are 

missing in sentences. (T / F)
8 Korean sentences that have no subject or object but just a verb are 

grammatically correct and natural in conversation. (T / F)
9 In Korean, different forms of expressions are used depending on who 

you are talking to or talking about. (T / F)

UNIT 3
Nouns

Words and word classes

Words are basic units that constitute a sentence. Each word in a sentence 
has different functions. Based on its grammatical function, each word is 
categorized into different classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and so 
on. Korean has the following word classes.

1 Nouns
2 Pronouns
3 Particles (that attach to a noun and indicate grammatical relationships 

or add special meanings)
4 Numbers and counters
5 Verbs (that indicate action or progress)
6 Adjectives (that indicate state or quality)
7 Copula (that indicate an equational expression:  “be” and  

“be not”)
8 Adverbs
9 Prenouns (that appear before a noun, like English demonstratives such 

as this, that, these, and those)

These Korean words in general fall into two categories: inflected words 
and uninflected words. Inflection refers to the process of adding some 
kinds of affixes to the original word in order to indicate grammatical 
features such as tense, number, aspect, and person. The addition of the 
affixes changes the shape of the original word in the process; however, it 
does not change its form class.

For instance, in English, the word “go” becomes “goes” with the affix 
“-es” when it is used for a third person singular. Another example is 
when the verb “study” changes its form to “studied” with the affix “-ed.” 
The process of adding such affixes refers to inflection. Notice that these 
inflected verbs end up having additional grammatical features (e.g., the 
third person verb usage and past tense) but their class does not change 
(e.g., they are still verbs).

16  Unit 3: Nouns

In Korean, the category of words that undergoes inflection includes 
verbs and adjectives. On the other hand, the category of words that does 
not undergo inflection includes nouns, pronouns, numbers, adverbs, and 
prenouns. All of these different classes of words will be discussed in detail 
throughout this book. However, this unit focuses on nouns. Nouns in general 
refer to the part of speech that indicates a name of thing, quality, place, 
person, or action. Nouns often serve as the subject and/or object of verbs 
and/or adjectives.

Formation of nouns

There are three components that constitute Korean nouns: native Korean 
words (about 35 percent); Sino-Korean words (about 60 percent), and 
loan words (about 5 percent). Generally speaking, Korean nouns can 
be comprised of either a single morpheme (or a meaningful unit), such as 

 “tree,”  “mountain,”  “bird,”  “water,” or multiple morphemes 
(e.g., a combination of several single morphemes) such as  “volcano” 
(  “fire” +  “mountain”) and  “beef” (  “cow” +  “meat”).

Nouns consisting of more than two morphemes are normally formed 
through either a derivational or a compounding process. The derivational 
formation takes an affix (e.g., either a prefix or a suffix), which normally 
appears in a noun and/or a predicate (e.g., a verb and/or an adjective). 
Prefixes refer to the affixes that appear before the word, whereas suffixes 
refer to the affixes that appear after the word.

Derivational prefixes:
• Native Korean prefix (e.g.,  “first”)
 •  “the first son” =  “first” +  “son”
 •  “the first daughter” =  “first” +  “daughter”
• Sino-Korean prefix (e.g.,  “new”)
 •  “a new semester” =  “new” +  “semester”
 •  “a new comer” =  “new” +  “person”

Derivational suffixes:
• Native Korean suffix (e.g.,  “doer”)
 •  “business man” =  “business” +  “doer”
 •  “worker” =  “work” +  “doer”
• Sino-Korean suffix (e.g.,  “study”)
 •  “Korean studies” =  “Korea” +  “study”
 •  “mathematics” =  “number” +  “study”
• Nouns, derived from verbs (e.g.,  “act”)
 •  “income” =  “earn” +  “act”
 •  “eating” =  “eat” +  “act”

9780415774871_C 03.indd   169780415774871_C03.indd   16 7/4/2008   1:35:52 PM7/4/2008   1:35:52 PM



 Unit 3: Nouns  17

• Nouns, derived from adjectives (e.g.,  “quality”)
 •  “size” =  “big” +  “quality”
 •  “length” =  “long” +  “quality”

As seen above, derivation is a useful way to understand how a word can 
be developed into another word with an affix, which carries an additional 
meaning.

On the other hand, compound nouns consist of two or more independ-
ent morphemes. They are divided into native and Sino-Korean compound 
nouns:

Native compound words:
• noun + noun
 • “tears” =  “eye” +  “water”
 •  “seal” =  “water” +  “dog”
• adverb + noun
 •  “curly hairs” =  “curved” +  “hair”
 •  “gentle breeze” =  “gentle” +  wind”
• noun + predicate + nominalizer
 •  “necklace” =  “neck” +  “hang” +  “act”
 •  “model” =  “example” +  “look” +  “act”
• predicate + noun
 •  “ oversleeping” =  “late” +  “sleeping”
 •  “icicle” =  “straight” +  “ice”
• clause + noun
 •  “cold water” =  “cold” +  “water”
 •  “stupid person” =  “ugly” +  “person”

Sino-Korean compound words
• Sino-Korean word + Sino-Korean word
 •  “parents” =  “father” +  “mother”
 •  “universe” =  “heaven” +  “earth”

Meanwhile, Korean has a group of special nouns that always appear 
before other nouns to modify or describe the following nouns, such as 

  “what kind of food,”   “this book,”   “that man,” 
and  “which restaurant.” These nouns are called “prenouns” 
(like English words, such as “that,” “this,” and “which”).

Some nouns are used only after the aforementioned prenouns. 
These special nouns (also sometimes called “bound nouns”) cannot be 
used by themselves but used always with the prenouns. Examples of 
these nouns are   “this place,”  “that person,”  “that thing,” 
and so on. Prenouns as well as bound nouns are discussed in detail in 
Unit 22.

18  Unit 3: Nouns

Some characteristics of Korean nouns

Marking plurality

English is very specific with respect to number in that when there is 
more than one item, the item must be marked by the plural “s.” However, 
Korean nouns are not specific about the number in that it does not have 
the grammatical category of number. For instance, a Korean noun  
“pencil” can be translated into at least the following: pencil, a pencil, the 
pencil, some pencils, the pencils, and pencils. Korean has the suffix  (that 
can be attached after a countable noun) for indicating the plurality of the 
noun. However, its usage is not mandatory for marking plurality, thus its 
purpose is rather for highlighting the plurality of the noun.

Position of nouns

Korean nouns appear in a sentence in one of the following ways: (1) by 
itself, (2) before particles, (3) before another noun, and (4) before copula. 
For instance, consider the following sentence:

 “Teacher, Susan is an American 
college student”

Notice that  “teacher” appears by itself;  “Susan” appears with 
the subjective particle ;  “America” appears before another noun 

 “college student”;  appears before  “copula.”
The Korean copula (or be-verbs such as “am,” “is,” and “are”) is  

(or  with the polite speech level). Korean nouns can serve as the 
sentence predicate with the copula. For instance, consider the following 
sentence:  “Tom is a student.” What is noteworthy is 
that the copula attaches to the noun so tightly as if it were a particle. 
For example, notice that there is no space between  and , as 
in .

Noun usage with verbs

People tend to use nouns with certain verbs. For instance, in English, the 
word “crime” is collocated with the verb “commit,” and “operation” is 
collocated with the verb “perform.” The use of a noun with a verb that is 
not conventionally collocated (although the use of the verb may be gram-
matically correct) results in an awkward expression (e.g., “Hitler committed 
a crime” vs. “Hitler performed a crime”). In the same principle, Korean 
nouns tend to collocate with certain verbs.

9780415774871_C 03.indd   189780415774871_C03.indd   18 7/4/2008   1:35:53 PM7/4/2008   1:35:53 PM



 Unit 3: Nouns  19

Consider the following examples:

 “Rebecca plays basketball” (X)
 “Rebecca plays (lit. does) basketball” (O)

The verb  literally means “play,” and  means “do.” However, in 
Korean, the noun  “basketball” does not collocate with , but with 

. For playing musical instruments such as piano and guitar, a different 
verb  “play” or “hit” is used instead of  or .

 “Rebecca plays piano” (X)
 “Rebecca plays (lit. does) piano” (X)
 “Rebecca plays (lit. hits/plays) piano” (O)

UNIT 4
Predicates and endings

Predicates

Predicate, one of the main components of a sentence, normally refers to 
the part that explains or says something about the subject. Often it refers 
to a verb or an adjective phrase that modifies the subject. For example, 
“closed the door” is the predicate of a sentence “Peter closed the door.” 
In a similar manner, those which constitute predicate expressions in 
Korean are verbs and adjectives.

Stems

Korean verbs and adjectives are made of stems and endings. The stems of 
verbs and adjectives do not stand alone, and they are always conjugated 
by various or inflectional endings. These endings carry various grammatical 
information and roles (e.g., tense, aspect, speech levels, and so forth).

When you look for the meaning of certain verbs and/or adjectives in 
your dictionary or textbook word lists, you are most likely to encounter 
verbs and adjectives with  as their endings (e.g.,  “sleep,”  “play,” 
and  “difficult”). Remember that stems do not stand by themselves. 
For a dictionary-entry purpose, Korean verbs and adjectives take a special 
dictionary form ending - . Consequently, finding the stem of a verb and/or 
an adjective is simple in that anything being left out after you take  out 
from the verbs and adjectives is the stem. Here are some examples:

Dictionary form Meaning Stem
 go 
 eat 

 learn 
 cook 

 bad 
 small 
 good 

 beautiful

24  Unit 4: Predicates and endings

Verbs and adjectives

In English, one can distinguish a verb from an adjective by looking at their 
structure. For example, when using an adjective as a predicate, one has 
to use one of “am,” “is,” and “are” (e.g., “the book is cheap”). In Korean, 
however verbs and adjectives resemble one another in how they inflect 
and how they function in the sentence. In addition, there is no obvi-
ous structural difference between verbs and adjectives. In fact adjectives 
behave like verbs so much that Korean grammarians categorize adjectives 
as “descriptive verbs.”

For example, in a dictionary, you may find the following Korean verb and 
adjective:  “go” and  “small.” They have different stems (  and 

) but the same ending (  the dictionary form ending). Their meanings 
distinguish a verb from an adjective. Verbs normally signify actions and 
processes. On the other hand, adjectives typically indicate states or qual-
ities (e.g., size, weight, quality, quantity, shape, appearance, perception, and 
emotion).

Vowel- and consonant-based stems

Stems of Korean verbs and adjectives are grouped into two types: consonant 
based and vowel based. An example of the vowel-based stem is  of 

, whereas that of the consonant-based stem is  of .

Vowel-based verbs
 “divide”
 “have”

 “teach”
 “touch”

 “see”
 “learn”

 “ride”

Consonant-based verbs
 “close”
 “wear (shoes)”
 “receive”
 “live”
 “sit”
 “read”
 “sell”

Endings

Since the stems of verbs and adjectives cannot be used alone, they are 
always used with endings. Korean has many different endings that convey 
much of the grammatical functions such as tense, aspects, sentence types, 
conjunctions, speech levels, and so on.

The endings can be categorized into two types: pre-final endings and final 
endings, depending on where they are placed in the verb or adjective.

Pre-final endings

Pre-final endings are inflectional elements that come between the stem 
and the final ending. They include the honorific suffix -( ) , past tense 
marker / , and so on.

Consider the following example:

 “Did (you) see the movie yesterday?”

Notice that the pre-final endings (e.g.,  and ) appear between , the 
stem “see,” and , “a sentence final ending.”

Non-sentence-final endings

There are two types of final endings: one that ends a verb or an adjec-
tive but not the sentence (non-sentence-final endings), and one that ends 

9780415774871_C 04.indd   259780415774871_C04.indd   25 7/4/2008   1:35:37 PM7/4/2008   1:35:37 PM



26  Unit 4: Predicates and endings

both the verb and the sentence (sentence-final endings). Non-sentence-
final endings include various clausal conjunctives such as -  “and then,” 
- /  “because,” -  “while,” -  “although,” -  “in order to,” 
and so on.

Consider the following sentence.

 “(I) drink coffee, and then eat 
ice cream”

Notice that the conjunctive -  “and then” does not end the sentence but 
does end the verb stem  “drink.” On the other hand, the ending  
ends the verb “eat” as well as the sentence.

Sentence-final endings

The typical examples of sentence-final endings are various speech-level 
endings. Korean has six speech levels as shown below. These speech-level 
endings indicate the speaker’s interpersonal relationship with the address-
ees or attitude toward them (e.g., social meanings such as intimacy and 
formality of the situation).

The deferential speech level is the highest among the six, followed 
by the polite speech level and so on. In addition, each speech level has 
four endings that indicate the type of sentence: declarative (statement), 
interrogative (question), imperative (command/request), and propositive 
(suggestion):

Speech level Declarative Interrogative Imperative Propositive
1 Deferential -  -  -  -

2 Polite - -  - -  - -  -
3 Blunt -  -  
4 Familiar -  - -  -  -
5 Intimate - -  - -  - -  - -
6 Plain -  - /-  - -  -

Among the six speech levels, the use of (3) blunt and (4) familiar speech 
levels have been declining especially among young generations. KFL 
learners however must be familiar with the deferential, polite, intimate, 
and plain levels, which are still widely used for all Koreans regardless 
of age differences. Consequently, the debate around blunt and familiar 
speech levels will not be discussed in this book.

Let us apply four of the endings above to the verb stem  “eat.” When 
saying “(someone) eats,” one needs to use one of the four interrogative 
endings (- , - , - , and - ).

9780415774871_C 04.indd   269780415774871_C04.indd   26 7/4/2008   1:35:37 PM7/4/2008   1:35:37 PM



 Unit 4: Predicates and endings  27

Level Conjugation  Possible social settings
Deferential  “(Someone) eats?”  (e.g., in a formal situation)
Polite  – (e.g., to an adult colleague)
Intimate  – (e.g., to an adolescent friend)
Plain   – (e.g., to a child)

Notice that the verb stem in each speech level as well as the referential 
meaning are the same. In addition, different endings render different social 
meanings, such as speaker’s attitude toward the hearer and the formality 
of the situation. Consequently, choosing the right speech level is critical, 
and it all depends on who you talk to.

UNIT 5
The deferential speech level and the polite 
speech level

In English, there are times when you have to take alternative words or 
phrases, depending on various social factors involved in conversation, 
such as the formality of the situation, politeness, and familiarity with the 
addressee. For instance, in a certain situation, you can greet someone by 
saying “Hey, what’s up!” but in another situation by saying “Good morn-
ing, Sir!”

Korean has different speech level endings for serving these purposes. As 
already emphasized in the previous unit, the use of speech level endings is 
mandatory all the time, since verb or adjective stems cannot stand alone. 
However, for Korean language learners, choosing an appropriate speech 
level ending for every verb and/or adjective is challenging because its selec-
tion is determined by various contextual factors involved in interaction, 
such as who you are talking to, whether you know the addressee or not, how 
formal the situation is, and so on. The focus of this unit is on two speech 
levels: “the deferential speech level” and “the polite speech level.”

The deferential speech level

The deferential speech level is used for public and/or formal commun-
ication settings, such as broadcasting, public speech, business-related 
meetings, conference presentations, and so forth. The deferential speech 
level has four different endings for each sentence type: - -  
(declarative), - - (interrogative), - imperative), 
and - (propositive).

Declarative

For the declarative (statement), -  is used when the stem ends in a 
consonant, as in  +  =  “(someone) eats.” However, when 
the stem ends in a vowel, -  is used, as in  +  =  
“(someone) goes.”

30  Unit 5: Deferential and polite speech levels

Because the deferential speech level indicates a sense of formality, many 
formulaic/fixed expressions are made of this speech level ending:

 “Nice to meet you” (literally, “(I) meet you for 
 the first time”)

 “Nice to meet you” (literally, “(I) am glad because 
 I meet you”)

 “Thanks for the meal” (literally, “(I) will eat 
 well”)

 “Thank you” (literally, “(I) do gratitude”)
 “Excuse me” (literally, “(I) do discourtesy”)
 “Congratulations” (literally, “(I) congratulate”)

Interrogative

For the interrogative (question), the ending is -  for the stem ending 
in a consonant, as in ? “(do you) eat?” However, it is -  
for the stem ending in a vowel, as in ? “(do you) go?” Here are 
more examples.

 “roast”   “When (do you) roast 
 the meat?”

 “believe”  “(Do you) believe that 
 friend?”

 “teach”   “Where (do you) 
 teach Korean?”

 “learn”  “When (do you) learn 
 Taekwondo?”

Imperative

For the imperative (command), the ending is -  for the stem ending 
in a consonant, as in  “eat.” However, the ending is -  for 
the stem ending in a vowel, as in  “go.” Here are more examples.

 “close”  “Close the window”
 “read”  “Read the Korean book”

 “meet” ! “Meet the teacher!”
 “see” ! “See the comedy movie!”

Propositive

For the propositive (suggestion), the ending is -  for the stem 
ending in a consonant, as in  “(let us) eat.” However, it is 

9780415774871_C 05.indd   309780415774871_C05.indd   30 7/4/2008   1:34:46 PM7/4/2008   1:34:46 PM



 Unit 5: Deferential and polite speech levels  31

-  for the stem ending in a vowel, as in  “(let us) go.” Here 
are more examples.

 “quit”  “(Let us) quit smoking”
 “sit”  “(Let us) sit in the front 

 row”
 “send out”   “(Let us) send out the letter”
 “throw away”  “(Let us) throw away the 

 garbage”

The polite speech level

The polite speech level is the informal counterpart of the deferential 
speech level. As the most commonly used speech level regardless of age 
or gender, the polite speech level is broadly used in any situation where 
polite language is called for. It is used when addressing someone of senior 
status in a casual, non-formal, and everyday types of conversations; it is 
used with friends if their friendship began in adulthood; it is the most 
common speech level used toward strangers.

The polite speech level endings have two forms: -  and - . 
When the verb and/or adjective stem ends in either  or , -  is used. 
On the other hand, -  is used with the stem that ends in any other 
vowels. For example, the following is a list of some verbs and adjectives 
(with dictionary endings) in the left column with the polite speech level 
ending -  in the right column:

Dictionary form The polite speech level endings
 “go”  (  +  but contracted to )
 “see”  (  +  but contracted)
 “come”  (  +  but contracted)
 “receive”  (  + )
 “live”  (  + )

 “wait”  (  +  but contracted 
 to )

 “learn”  (  +  but contracted)
 “put (something) in”  (  + )
 “tie”  (  + )
 “eat”  (  + )

You probably wonder why some verbs or adjectives such as  is not 
, but . This is attributed to the vowel contraction in Korean: 

when similar or the same two vowels appear together (e.g.,  = ), 
the vowels tend to be contracted.

32  Unit 5: Deferential and polite speech levels

The copula  “be” and  “be not” as well as the verb  
“do” do not follow the above rules. The conjugation of , , and 

 is irregular in that the polite speech level of  is ,  
is , and  is .

  (X)  (O)
  (X)  (O)

  (X)  (O)

The endings -  are used for all sentence types: declarative, imperat-
ive, interrogative, and propositive. For instance, consider the following:

 “(I) eat lunch”
 “(Do you) eat lunch?”
 “Eat lunch!”

. “(Let us) eat lunch”

Koreans use contextual elements as well as intonation (e.g., rising intonation 
for a question) to figure out what sentence type the ending is used for.

Mixed use of the deferential and polite speech 
levels

Koreans frequently use the deferential speech level as well as the polite 
speech level together even in formal conversational settings. One pos-
sible scenario is when you meet a person for the first time. The speakers 
may introduce themselves using the deferential speech level (using the 
aforementioned fixed expressions). However, once identified, they may 
switch to the polite speech level. The use of the polite speech level ending 
generates an effect of making a dialogue sound less formal, even in formal 
conversational contexts.

UNIT 6
The subject case particle /  i/ka

Case and special particles

One unique characteristic of Korean is that nouns are typically marked by 
particles. There is no corresponding equivalent in English. Korean has two 
types of particles: case particles and special particles. Case particles indicate 
the syntactic role of the noun to which they are attached (e.g., whether the 
noun is a subject, an object, an indirect object, and so on). Case particles 
include /  “subject case particle,” /  “object case particle,” and so 
on. Consider the following exemplary sentence:

 “Charles drinks coffee”

 is the subject, as it is marked by the subject particle . In addition, 
 is the object, as it is marked by the object particle .

The other type is “special particles” whose function is not to indicate 
syntactic roles of the noun but rather to add special meanings, such as 
indicating the noun as a topic of the sentence, emphasizing the singular-
ity of the noun, and so on. Special particles include /  “topic particle” 
and delimiters such as  “only,”  “also,” and so on. Consider the follow-
ing example:

 “As for a car, Hyundai Sonata is good”

Notice that  is the subject of the sentence (since marked by 
the subject particle ), while  is not the subject but the topic of the 
sentence (since marked by the topic particle ).

Characteristics of particles

There are few things to remember when using these particles. First, al-
though particles are tightly bound to and are an integral part of the noun, 
they can be often omitted in colloquial usages. This omission in colloquial 

9780415774871_C 06.indd   399780415774871_C06.indd   39 7/4/2008   1:34:30 PM7/4/2008   1:34:30 PM



40  Unit 6: The subject case particle /

conversation is possible because the contextual understanding of the con-
versation is often sufficient to indicate the syntactic roles of the nouns 
being used (e.g., knowing who is a subject or an object and so on). However, the 
omission of the particles is not allowed in formal written communication.

Second, because of the case particle’s role of indicating the syntactic role 
of the nouns, the word order can be scrambled. For instance, notice that the 
following two sentences have the same meaning, even if the word order of 
both sentences (e.g., the subject  and the object ) is different.

 “Charles drinks coffee”
 “Charles drinks coffee”

The subject particle 

The subject case particle  is a two-form particle.  is used when the 
particle comes after a noun that ends in a consonant (e.g.,  “bag- 
particle”), and  is used when the particle comes after a noun that ends 
in a vowel (e.g.,  “school-particle”). The principle of having two 
forms resembles the use in English of “a/an.” However, the rule is the 
opposite in that “an” is used before a noun that begins with a vowel (e.g., 
an umbrella) and “a” is used before a noun that begins with a consonant 
(e.g., a cup).

The particle  in negation

Although the primary function of  is to indicate the subject case, its 
usage extends beyond case marking. For example, in negation the noun it 
marks is not the subject of the sentence. Consider the following example:

 “As for Sara, (she) is not a Korean”

 is not the subject but the topic of the sentence (as it is marked by the 
topic particle ). Notice that the subject of the sentence is omitted, and 

, marked by the particle , is not the subject of the sentence.

Double subject constructions

Some Korean sentences may have two nouns marked by the subject par-
ticle. Consider the following example:

 “Three friends came”

Notice that there are two subjects in the sentence,  and , as 
both are marked by the subject particle. Korean grammarians call such a 

9780415774871_C 06.indd   409780415774871_C06.indd   40 7/4/2008   1:34:30 PM7/4/2008   1:34:30 PM



 Unit 6: The subject case particle /   41

sentence “double-subject construction.” Double-subject sentences are very 
common in Korean. However, its interpretation is not that the sentence 
has two subjects. In this sentence, the focus is on the number three rather 
than friends.

Consider another example:

 “Thomas’s hands are big”

In this sentence, the relationship between two nouns,  and , is 
that of the possessor-possessed.

It is rather confusing which noun marked by the particle should be 
regarded as the emphasized subject. Koreans use context as well as other 
linguistic cues (e.g., intonation) to figure out where the emphasis lies. The 
importance of contextual understanding is also evident in the fact that 
Korean subjects as well as particles are often omitted in conversation.

UNIT 7
The special particle  0n/  n0n

The special particle  is a topic particle since it marks the noun as 
the sentence topic (e.g., what the sentence is about). The particle  is 
not a case particle; hence it does not indicate the grammatical function 
of the noun it attaches to.

Marking topics

In a similar way that the subject particle has two forms  and , the topic 
particle also has two forms:  (after consonants) and  (after vowels). 
Consider the following two sentences:

 “As for Susan, (she) is a Korean”
 “As for Danny, (he) is an American”

Notice that  is marked by  (since it ends in a consonant), whereas 
 is marked by  (since it ends in a vowel). In addition, the above 

two sentences are “topic-comment” structures: a sentence begins with a 
topic of the sentence (marked by the topic particle ), followed by the 
predicate (e.g., an equational expression). In the first sentence above,  
is the topic and  is the comment. In the second sentence, 

 is the topic, while  is the comment. Such a topic-
comment structure is the most basic sentence type in Korean.

To understand its usage in more detail, let us consider the following 
examples:

 “As for Leah, (she) is an American”
 “(She) is a high-school teacher”

 “(She) is 28 years old”
 “As for James, (he) is a Canadian”

9780415774871_C 07.indd   479780415774871_C07.indd   47 7/4/2008   1:35:07 PM7/4/2008   1:35:07 PM



48  Unit 7: The special particle /

Notice that the first three sentences are about Leah. Because of the fact 
that Leah was noted as the topic in the first sentence, it would be redundant 
to raise Leah as the topic again. Consequently, the second and the third 
sentence omit the topic . However, as the fourth sentence is about a 
different person , the sentence begins with the new topic, .

The noun marked by  appears to be the subject of the sentence. 
However,  is not a subject particle and it does not mark the noun as 
the subject. For instance, consider the following sentence:

“As for hamburgers, Smith 
Hamburger is tasty”

Notice that the hamburger is the topic of the sentence (what the sentence 
is talking about), whereas “Smith Hamburger” is the subject of the pre-
dicate “tasty.”

Compare and contrast

When two sentences, marked by the topic particles , are used in 
parallel, the particle  serves to compare and contrast the two topics 
of the sentences. Consider the following two examples:

 “As for Justin, (he) is a Canadian”
 “However, as for Chieko, (she) 

is a Japanese”

Notice that both Justin and Chieko are the topics of each sentence. Since 
these sentences are used in parallel, these two topics are compared and 
contrasted (e.g., one is a Canadian while the other person is Japanese).

Switching topics

Koreans use the topic particle when they switch the topic from one 
thing to another. For instance, consider the following conversation.

A:  “Excuse me, how much is this pair 
of pants?”

B:  . “Yes, (it) is 20,000 won.”
A:  ,  “Then, as for this skirt, how much is 

(it)?”
B:  . “Yes, (it) is 32,000 won.”
A:   “How about this pair of jeans?”

 Unit 7: The special particle /   49

Let us assume that speaker A is a customer and speaker B is a saleswoman 
in the above conversation. Notice that speaker A uses the topic particle 

 when she changes the topic from one item to another (e.g., asking 
for the price of a skirt, and then jeans).

Interplay between the subject and the topic 
particles

When asking a question in Korean, the question word (e.g.,  “what,” 
 “who”) is usually marked by the subject particle . However, 

when answering the question, the question word is often marked by the 
topic particle . Consider the following examples:

Peter:   “What is (your) major?”
Susan: . “As for (my) major, (it) is Korean.”

In Peter’s question, the particle  is used since  “major” is the 
subject of the question. However, when responding to this question, Susan 
answers   “As for (my) major, (it) is Korean,” instead of 

 “The major is Korean.” Notice that  is marked by 
the topic particle , not the subject particle .

When Peter asks the question,  is the subject of the sentence and 
it is not the topic of the conversation yet. In other words, the word  is 
new information which was just brought up in the conversation. However, 
after Peter’s question,  becomes the topic. As a result, Susan replies 
with  rather than .

This may sound confusing but, it should become clear with more examples. 
Consider the following examples:

A:  “What is (your) name?”
B:  . “As for my name, (it) is Andrew.”

A:   “Where is (your) hometown?”
B:  . “As for my hometown, (it) is Seoul.”

Appearing at the beginning of the sentence

You can make any element of the sentence the topic by adding the topic 
particle to it and placing it at the beginning of the sentence, except the 
verb/adjective that appears at the end of the sentence. For example, 
consider the following sentences:

9780415774871_C 07.indd   499780415774871_C07.indd   49 7/4/2008   1:35:08 PM7/4/2008   1:35:08 PM



50  Unit 7: The special particle /

“As for John, (he) studies Korean with Mary at the library at 
9:00 a.m.”

“At 9:00 a.m., John studies Korean with Mary at the library.”

“With Mary, John studies Korean at the library at 9:00 a.m.”

“At the library, John studies Korean with Mary at 9:00 a.m.”

As a SOV language, in Korean the most important sentential elements (e.g., 
predicates) tend to appear at the end of the sentence. The less import-
ant or least unknown information tend to appear toward the beginning of 
the sentence. Notice in the above sentences that the  -marked ele-
ments (topics) appear at the beginning of the sentence. The topic of the 
sentence in Korean tends to be the contextually understood element, and 
thus it can be often easily omitted during conversation.

This contrasts with the subject marked by the particle . The subject 
particle  is used to mark a subject (which happens to be new informa-
tion or has not been mentioned previously in the context). For instance, this 
explains why most interrogative words such as  “who,”  “what,” 

 “when,” and  “which,” are used with the particle , as in 
( ), and , but not with the topic particle :

 “Which restaurant food is delicious?” 
(X)

 “Which restaurant food is delicious?” 
(O)

 “Who is an American?” (X)
 “Who is an American?” (O)

UNIT 8
Pronouns

English has an extensive list of pronouns: I (me, my, mine), you (your, 
yours), he (him, his), she (her, hers), it (its), we (us, our, ours), and they 
(them, their, theirs). Korean has its own list of pronouns as well, but 
its usage is much limited with different usage rules. Generally speaking, 
pronouns are used much less in Korean than in English. In Korean, any 
contextually understood sentence elements (including the subject and the 
object) are often omitted. For instance, when two people are talking to each 
other, personal pronouns often drop out in normal conversations, since both 
speakers know who is the first person talking and who is listening. This 
differs from English, where the use of the pronoun (or subject noun) is 
mandatory in all situations. For instance, it would be grammatically wrong 
or incomplete to say “ate lunch?”

The first person pronoun

The Korean first person pronouns have the plain and humble forms:

 (plain singular)   (humble singular)
 (plain singular possessive)  (humble singular possessive)

 (plain plural/possessive)   (humble plural/possessive)

There are two things to remember when using the first person pronouns. 
First, the use of either plain or humble pronouns depends on who you 
are talking to. It is always safe to use the humble form when you talk to 
adult speakers whom you do not know well. In addition, the use of humble 
form is normally collocated with honorific elements (e.g., the deferential 
speech level endings, the honorific suffix -( ) , the euphemistic words, 
and so forth).

Second,  “the first person plural pronoun” has a wider usage. 
Due to the collectivistic value system, deeply embedded in the Korean 
language and culture,  is also used as the first person possessive 

9780415774871_C 08.indd   559780415774871_C08.indd   55 7/4/2008   1:34:10 PM7/4/2008   1:34:10 PM



56  Unit 8: Pronouns

pronoun, when referring to communal possessions (e.g., one’s family or 
household, the school he/she attended and so on). Consider the following 
two sentences:

( )  “Our (my) older brother is 
in Albany, NY”

( )  “My older brother is in Albany, 
NY”

Both sentences are grammatically and pragmatically correct. However, the 
first sentence is preferred over the second.

The second person pronoun

The Korean second person pronouns have the plain and polite forms:

 (plain singular)  (polite singular)
 (plain singular possessive)  (polite singular possessive)

 (plain plural)  (polite plural)

The use of Korean second person pronoun is much more limited than that 
of English. For example, Koreans use  only when addressing a child, a 
childhood friend, one’s younger sibling, one’s son/daughter, and so forth. 
The use of  is mostly used between spouses.

In fact, there is no second person pronoun for addressing an adult 
equal or senior in Korean. One possible explanation is that addressing 
someone by the pronoun sounds too direct and confrontational in Korean. 
As a result, Koreans avoid using the second person pronoun unless the 
addressee is someone they know well (e.g., friends), and/or is of equal or 
lower status (e.g., one’s subordinates).

One may wonder then how Koreans actually address someone. The 
safest way is not to use any pronoun at all. However, if unavoidable, the 
best alternative is to use addressee terms as second person pronouns. As 
shown below, Korean has many ways to address someone. When using an 
address term, a speaker has to know the addressee’s social status as well 
as the relationship with the speaker him/herself.

For instance, a businessman  “Kim, Youngsoo” can be addressed 
in his work place at least in the following ways:

  “Section chief” (professional title  + honorific title , 
when his junior colleagues address him).

 “Section chief Kim” (last name  + professional title , 
when his boss addresses him).

9780415774871_C 08.indd   569780415774871_C08.indd   56 7/4/2008   1:34:10 PM7/4/2008   1:34:10 PM



 Unit 8: Pronouns  57

  “Senior Kim” (last name  + rank term , when his 
junior colleague who happens to have graduated from the 
same high school addresses him).

 “Mr. Youngsoo Kim” (full name  + neutral title , 
when adult distant friends who are of equal or higher status 
address him).

Notice that the difference in status (e.g., who has the higher status or 
power between the speaker and the addressee) and the familiarity (e.g., 
how close or familiar the speaker is with the addressee/referent) deter-
mines the choice of term.

In his personal life, Youngsoo Kim can be addressed by different terms. 
For instance, his wife may call him  “darling,”  “dear,” and  
“older brother” (if she is younger than him). If he has a son or a daughter, 
the wife can even call him  “dad.” His friends can call him by just 
his first name . His parents can call him by the first name with the 
vocative - , as in .

Then how would you address someone in a store or restaurant set-
tings? Again, the safest way is not to say any pronoun at all. Instead 
of pronouns, you can get people’s attention by saying  “here” or 

 “excuse me.”

The third person pronoun

Strictly speaking, Korean has no true third person pronoun. Koreans use 
a demonstrative (e.g., this, these, that, and those) and a noun (e.g., man, 
woman, thing, people, and so on) to refer to the third person:

He
 “that,”  “that person,”  “that esteemed person,” 
 “that man” . . .

She
 “that,”  “that person,”  “that esteemed person,” 
 “that lady”  . . .

They
 “those,”  “those people,”  “those esteemed 

people” . . .

Beside these terms, Koreans use various kinship terms in place of the 
third person pronoun.

58  Unit 8: Pronouns

Kinship terms

Due to the collectivistic and hierarchical values embedded in the Korean 
language and culture, Korean has a list of highly stratified and extensive 
kinship terms. The Korean kinship terms indicate how one is related to 
others in intricate ways (e.g., whether the relative is a male or female, 
whether the relative is older or younger, whether the relative is on the 
mother’s or father’s side, and so on).

The Korean kinship terms can be divided into two groups. The first group 
has two kinship term sets depending on the gender of the person related.

 A male’s A female’s
father-in-law 
mother-in-law 
spouse ( )
brothers 
older brother 
older sister 

The second group includes the kinship terms, used by both genders.

father)

 Unit 8: Pronouns  59

paternal aunt  (both older or younger sister of one’s 
father)

(the wife of an older brother of 
one’s father)

 or  (the wife of a married 
younger brother of one’s father)

maternal uncle  (both older and younger brother 
of one’s mother, regardless of their marital 
status)

 (the husband of a sister of one’s 
mother)

maternal aunt  (both older or younger sister of one’s 
mother)

 (the wife of both older or younger 
brother of one’s mother)

son-in-law 
daughter-in-law 
cousin 

Koreans use kinship terms as both address and/or reference terms for 
their kin-members. For instance, it is rare for younger brothers or sisters 
to address their older siblings by their first name.

Due to the collectivistic and hierarchical value orientations of Korean, 
Koreans use some kinship terms when they address or refer to non-kin 
members, such as friends, friends’ family members, and/or even strangers. 
For instance, Koreans often use  when addressing and/or referring 
to their friends’ mother. When addressing a stranger who looks obviously 
old (say, over 60s), Koreans use  or .

Indefinite pronouns

People use indefinite pronouns when they refer to something that does not 
have a specific referent. The examples of indefinite pronouns in English 
include something, someone, sometimes, somewhere, anything, anyone, and 
so forth. Korean interrogative words such as “where,”  “when,” 

 “who,”  “what,” and  “which” function as question words as 
well as indefinite pronouns. What determines the use of these words as 
question words or indefinite pronouns is intonation.

When the word is used as a question, the sentence that contains the 
question word has a rising intonation at the end. However, without a rising 
intonation, the question word functions as an indefinite pronoun.

Sino-Korean numbers and native Korean 
numbers

In Korean, there are two parallel sets of numbers. One of these was bor-
rowed from Chinese long ago and is now part of the Korean number system. 
The numbers belonging to this set are called Sino-Korean numbers. The 
other set is of native origin. The numbers belonging to this set are called 
native Korean numbers. These two sets are shown below.

As seen above, the Korean number system is more systematic than the 
English number system when it comes to the formation of higher numbers. 
For instance, while English uses special words for 11 through 19, such as 
eleven, twelve and so on, Korean numbers are formed “ten + one”  
or , “ten + two”  or  and so on.

For multiples of ten, Sino-Korean numbers are simple combinations: 
20 is “two + ten” , 30 is “three + ten” , and so on. However, 
native Korean numbers have special words, as 20 is , 30 is , 
and so on. In addition, the native Korean number set does not have the 
number “zero.”

The use of Sino-Korean numbers and native Korean numbers differs 
in a number of ways. First, as indicated by the asterisk mark above, native 
Korean numbers “one,” “two,” “three,” “four,” and “twenty” have slightly 
modified forms. Koreans use these modified forms when they count one 
of these native numbers with a counter (e.g.,  a counter for person). For 
instance, one person would be , rather than 

Second, Koreans use native Korean numbers when counting a small 
number of objects. For instance, three bottles of beers would be 

 (beer + three + bottles). However, when counting a large number 
of objects, they prefer using Sino-Korean numbers, as “62 bottles of 
beers” would be .

Third, from 100 and above, Koreans use only Sino-Korean numbers. 
Consequently, 134 would be read as . It is optional to add  to 
the number that starts with 1, such as 100, 1000, and so on, however, it is 
more common to say the number without it. For instance, for 100, saying 
“  (hundred)” is more common than saying “  (one hundred).”

It is rare but you can read a number that is over 100, by combining a 
Sino-Korean number and a native Korean number. For instance, 134 can 
be read as  (Sino-Korean number + native Korean number). 
However, the use of Sino-Korean numbers is more dominant than a mixed 
use of both sets of numbers.

Finally, Koreans in general use Sino-Korean numbers when doing math-
ematical calculations. 

 8 × 3 = 24  
12 + 7 = 19  
 9 − 4 = 5 
20 ÷ 5 = 4 

Counting

There are two ways of counting countable objects. You can just use a 
number by itself or use a number with a counter (the function of a counter 
is to indicate the type of noun being counted). When counting without a 
counter, you use native Korean numbers. For instance, for “two students,” 
you can say  (noun + number).

One student 
Two students 
Three students 
Four students 
Five students 
Six students  
Ten students 

Counting items with a counter can take the following structure: “noun 
(being counted) + number + counter.” Consequently, for “five students” 
you would say “  +  + .”

When you use native Korean numbers with a counter, you should 
remember that native Korean numbers for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 20 have slightly 
different forms: , , , , and . Consequently,

Ordinals

The Sino-Korean and native Korean numbers differ in the formation of 
ordinals (e.g., regarding order, rank or position in a series). For Sino-
Korean numbers, Koreans attach the prefix  to a number. For instance, 
“the first” is , “the eleventh” is , and so on. For native Korean 
numbers, they add  to a number. Accordingly, “the fifth” is 

, “the eleventh” is , and so on. The only exception is that 
 “the native number for one” is not used for the ordinal, but one 

needs to use the special word, , as , not .

 Unit 9: Numbers, ordinals, plural marker   69

Plural marker 

You probably wonder by now whether Koreans care whether a noun is 
singular or plural. It is because none of the examples above carry any 
plural marker. The plural marker for Korean is . However, its usage 
differs from that of English, such as the plural “s.” English is very specific 
with respect to number in that when there is more than one item, the item 
must be marked by the plural “s.” However, Korean nouns are not specific 
about the number. In other words, the Korean language does not have a 
grammatical category of number.

For instance, “one student” in Korean is and “five students” 
is . Notice that the noun  “student” does not undergo any 
change in form. Consider the following sentence . 
The translation of this sentence can be fourfold, as shown.

I have a chair and a desk.
I have some chairs and a desk.
I have a chair and some desks.
I have some chairs and some desks.

You may wonder then when  is used. Koreans optionally add  to 
the noun when they want to emphasize the plurality of the nouns they 
are referring to. For instance,  may mean “a student comes” 
and also mean “some students come.” However, Koreans can optionally 
add  as  “students come,” if they wish to emphasize the 
plurality of .

Koreans use  for other cases too, such as adding the marker not only 
to the noun but also to pronouns. For instance, although it may sound 
redundant, Koreans can add  to  “we,” as in  “we.” Notice 
that  is already plural. Again, such usage is for adding emphasis.

UNIT 10
Counters, question word  my9t, 
and some time expressions

Counters

What a counter does is to classify nouns according to common attributes 
for numbering purposes. Therefore, by using a counter, you can provide 
more information about the object you count. The Korean language has 
an extensive list of counters. Some counters are used only with the native 
Korean numbers, whereas some counters are used only with the Sino-Korean 
numbers. Table 10.1 shows the counters that are normally used with the 
native Korean numbers. However, when the number is above 20 these 
counters can also be used with Sino-Korean numbers.

On the other hand, Table 10.2 shows the counters that are used only with 
Sino-Korean numbers. Notice that when the counter is a loanword, such as 

 “dollars,”  “miles,” and  “meters,” Koreans in general prefer 
to use Sino-Korean numbers, as in  “fifteen dollars.”

As seen above, the choice of a certain counter depends on the kinds of 
objects. However, one must know what counter is used with either a native 
Korean number or a Sino-Korean number. For instance, when counting 
minutes, you have to use after a Sino-Korean number, as in  “five 
minutes.”

A few counters, such as  or  “week,” can be used with both 
Sino-Korean numbers as well as native Korean numbers. For instance, 
one week can be either  or  and five weeks can be either 

 or . However, the use of Sino-Korean numbers with 
this counter is more common.

 Unit 10: Counters, question word , time expressions  75

Question word 

Korean has a question word  “how many.” The word cannot be used 
on its own but must precede a counter. For example, a specific question 
expression such as “how many people” would be , “how many months” 
would be , and so on. One can form various question expressions 
using the aforementioned counters, such as:

 “How many people?”
 “How many items?”
 “What time?”
 “How old?”
 “How many bottles?”
 “How many (books)?”
 “What month?”
 “What floor?”

Some frequently used counters

Using the appropriate counters with the right number set is a systematic but 
complex process. Students need to practice them in order to be proficient 
in using them. For instance, let us elaborate on some of the frequently 
used counters used for telling times, days, months, and years.

Telling times

Koreans use native Korean numbers for  “o’clock” but Sino-Korean 
numbers for  “minutes.” In addition, for a.m. and p.m., Koreans use the 
following five words:  “morning” or  “before noon” for a.m., and 

 “afternoon,”  “evening,” and  “night” for p.m., at the beginning 
of the expression.

07:36 a.m. 
08:10 a.m.  
10:45 a.m. 
02:50 p.m. 
06:17 p.m.   
09:24 p.m.  
11:38 p.m.   

To say half past, you can either say “ ” or an expression , meaning 
“a half.” Consequently, the Korean expression for telling 11:30 p.m. can 
be: .

76  Unit 10: Counters, question word , time expressions

Counting days

Counting days with Sino-Korean numbers is regular. You need to add  
“a counter for day” after the number, such as , , , and so 
on. However, counting days with native Korean numbers is irregular, in 
that there are special words for days up to 20 as shown below.

one day 
two days 
three days 
four days 
five days 
six days 
seven days 
eight days 
nine days 
ten days 
eleven days 
twelve days 
thirteen days 
twenty days 

After 20, only Sino-Korean expressions are used.

Counting months and years

Koreans use Sino-Korean numbers for counting months. Hence, you need 
to add  “months” after a Sino-Korean number, as in , , , 
and so on. However, be careful that Koreans do not say June as  but 

 and October not as  but .

January 
February 
March 
April 
May 
June 
July 
August 
September 
October 
November 
December

 Unit 10: Counters, question word , time expressions  77

For months (duration), however, you can use either native Korean numbers 
or Sino-Korean numbers. When counting with Sino-Korean numbers, you 
add  after the number as in , , , and so on. 
When counting with native Korean numbers, you add  after the number, 
as in , , and so on.

1 month (duration) 
2 months 
3 months  (or )
4 months  (or )
5 months 
6 months 
7 months 
8 months 
9 months 

For years, Koreans normally use Sino-Korean numbers with  “year,” such 
as ,  , , and so on. They use native Korean numbers for 
years only for small numbers, such as  and . However, Koreans 
rarely use native Korean numbers beyond  .

1 year 
2 years 
3 years  –
4 years  –
5 years  –
60 years  –
100 years  –

Dates

Let us put all these expressions together. Koreans give dates starting from 
the largest unit to the smallest. This is the opposite of the English expres-
sion. For instance, date information such as “2:19 p.m., 18 May, 1970” is 
said as “( ) , .” Here are 
more examples:

9:35 a.m., 11 April, 2004

3:57 p.m., 25 December, 1992

7:08 a.m., 16 March, 1979

UNIT 11
The copula  and the verb of 
existence and location 

In English, copulas “am,” “are,” and/or “is” can express at least two things. 
First, they are used to indicate the equational expression (e.g., something 
equals something), as in “John is a student” or “Hyundai is an automobile 
company.” In addition, they indicate that something is located or existing 
as in “There are Korean people” or “Honolulu is in Hawaii.” In Korean, 
two different words express these two functions. For the equational expres-
sion, Korean has the copula  (or  for negation). For the verb of 
existence or location, Korean has the verb  (or  for negation).

Equational expressions 

The dictionary form for the Korean copula is . The stem of the copula 
is  (as you take  “the dictionary ending” out). With the polite speech 
level ending, the copula  becomes  for the preceding noun that 
ends in a consonant, as in  “(I) am Daniel.” For the preceding 
noun that ends in a vowel, the copula  becomes , as in 

 “(I) am Andrew.” With different speech levels, such as the deferential 
speech level ending, the copula becomes  (  + ).

 always follows the noun it expresses. In other words, it 
cannot be used separately from the noun. For instance, consider the fol-
lowing sentences:

 “As for Cathy, (she) is a teacher”
 “As for Daniel, (he) is a medical doctor”

Notice that  attaches to  (since the last syllable  ends in 
a consonant ), while in the second sentence,  comes after  (as 
the last syllable  ends in the vowel ).

9780415774871_C 11.indd   819780415774871_C11.indd   81 7/4/2008   1:37:42 PM7/4/2008   1:37:42 PM



82  Unit 11: Copula and the verb of existence and location

Negation -

The Korean copula for negation is . The stem of the negative copula 
 becomes  with the polite speech level ending. For negating an 

equational expression, the subject particle  is used with , 
as in:

 “As for Nicole, (she) is not a Korean”
 “As for Matthew, (he) is not an engineer”

Notice that the noun that is being negated has the subject particle  
(after the noun ending in a consonant) or  (after the noun endings in 
a vowel).

Existence and location with  and 
case particle 

The Korean verb  means “exist/exists” or “there is/are.” For negation, 
Korean has a separate verb  “do/does not exist” or “is/are not located.” 
Since  expresses “something exists” or “something is located (some-
where),” it is normally called the verb of existence and location.

When referring to a location of an object, you need a location, a loca-
tive particle “ ,” and the verb of existence and location “ .” For 
instance, consider the following sentences.

 “John is in London”
 “Honolulu is in Hawaii”

Notice that the locations ( , ) are marked by the particle , 
and they are followed by the verb .

For a more specific location reference, various Korean location nouns 
can be used. Korean has the following location nouns:

  “above”
 “below”

 “under”
 “behind”
 “front”
 “inside”
 “outside”
 “side”

 “right side”
 “left side”

9780415774871_C 11.indd   829780415774871_C11.indd   82 7/4/2008   1:37:42 PM7/4/2008   1:37:42 PM



 Unit 11: Copula and the verb of existence and location  83

Using one of the location nouns, you can be more explicit in referring 
to the location and/or position of the noun, as in  
“The book is on the table.”

You may wonder if these location words are like various prepositions 
in English such as “above,” “below,” “on,” “beside,” and “behind.” These 
English prepositions are similar to Korean location nouns in the sense 
that they both function to indicate the specific reference of the location. 
However, they are different in two aspects. First, while English preposi-
tions always appear before the object of the location (as in “above the 
table”), those in Korean always appear after the object (as in  
“table-above”). Another difference is that these Korean postpostional 
elements are nouns and they are normally followed by the locative particle 

, whereas English prepositional elements are not nouns.

 vs. 

When asking for the specific location of a certain object, Koreans use the 
question word  “where” with the verb , as in:

( )  “Where is the bank (lit., where does the bank 
exist)?”

Notice that the question word  appears right before the verb .
One can use  with , as in ? “Where is the 

bank?” However, notice that the question does not seek the specific loca-
tion of , rather it simply questions the general whereabouts of . 
In other words, the copula  cannot be used to refer to the location 
of an object.

For example, for the above question, a response such as 
 “The bank is (lit., exists) behind the school library” is 

acceptable. However,  “The bank is the back 
of the school library” is not acceptable since these two responses do not 
mean the same thing.

For another example, take the following two sentences:

 (O) “Seoul is in Korea (lit., Seoul exists in 
Korea)”

 (X) “Seoul is Korea”

As seen above, these two sentences do not have the same meaning.

84  Unit 11: Copula and the verb of existence and location

The use of  to express “possession”

Another meaning of  is to express one’s possession. In the 
following example,  is better translated as “have/has.”

( )  “As for Peter, (he) has an Apple 
Computer”

The literal translation of the above sentence may be “As for Peter, there is 
an Apple Computer” or “As for Peter, an Apple Computer exists.” However, 
it actually means (or is better translated into English) “As for Peter, (he) 
has an Apple Computer.” Notice that Apple Computer is marked by the 
subject particle . KFL learners, whose native language is English, tend 
to make an error using  the object particle (instead of ). This is 
because of the native language transfer effect. They intuitively judge the 
verb “have” should have an object, since its direct English translation may 
be “Peter has an Apple Computer.”

UNIT 12
Case particles 1 

 0l/  l0l and  (0)ro

The direct object particle 

The direct object refers to a noun that experiences the action indicated 
by the verb. In English the direct object of the sentence is typically deter-
mined by the place where it appears. For instance, the direct object of the 
sentence “I eat steak” is “steak,” as the word “steak” appears after the 
verb “eat.” In Korean, however the direct object is primarily determined 
by the direct object particle . Just like the subject particle, the direct 
object particle  is a two-form case particle:  is used when the 
preceding noun ends in a consonant, and  is used when the preceding 
noun ends in a vowel.

 “(I) read a book”
 “(I) buy a pencil”
 “(I) see a movie”

 “(I) drink cola”

Although the particle  typically marks the direct object of the tran-
sitive verb in Korean, there is one exceptional case where it can appear 
with the intransitive verb, such as  “go” or  “come.” Consider the 
following sentences:

 “As for Andrew, (he) goes to 
school at 8 a.m.”

 “As for Andrew, (he) goes to school 
at 8 a.m.”

Notice that  “school” can be marked by the locative particle “ ” as 
well as the direct object particle “ .”

90  Unit 12: Case particles 1

Noun + 

In Korean, one of the most useful ways to change a noun into a verb form 
is by adding  to a noun. The verb  “do” is very resource-
ful and adaptable in that it can come after a noun and transforms the 
meaning denoted by the noun as the verb form. For instance, consider 
the following sentences:

 “Steven signs” (lit., “does signing”)
 “Naoko speaks English well”

 “Mary plays soccer”
 “Natalie does aerobics”

 “Paul surfs”
? “Where do (you) work?”

 “(I) clean my room on Saturday”
 “(I) do laundry at friend’s house”

 “(I) do homework at school”

In this noun +  +  construction, the noun being used is treated as 
an independent noun due to the presence of the direct object particle . 
However, without the particle, the construction is treated as a compound 
verb. For instance, the following two sentences have the same meanings:

 “(I) do signing”
 “I sign”

Notice that the first sentence has the particle , while the second sentence 
does not have it. There is no difference in their meanings.

In Korean, a sentence may have two object particles. For instance, 
a sentence “John signs the contract” can be said 

. However, the same can be said in the following three more ways:

 “John signs the contract”
 “John signs the contract”
 “John signs the contract”

The absence of the particles in the above examples is due to the particle 
omission tendency in the Korean language.

Case particle 

The case particle  is a two-form particle: appears after a noun 
that ends in a consonant (as in  “by books”);  appears after a 
noun that ends in a vowel (as in  “by bus”) or the consonant  

9780415774871_C 12.indd   909780415774871_C12.indd   90 7/4/2008   1:38:01 PM7/4/2008   1:38:01 PM



 Unit 12: Case particles 1  91

(as in “by shoes”). The particle ( )  can express the following 
five things: (1) means, (2) direction, (3) selection, (4) the change of state, 
and (5) reason.

Means

First, the particle  indicates that the noun it attaches to is a tool or 
an instrument. It is translated in English as “by means of” or “with.”

 “Please sign with a pen”
 “(I) go to school by bus”

 “Go to the airport by taxi”
 “As for wine, (one) makes it with grape”

 “As for kimchi, (one) makes it with 
cabbage”

Direction

Second, the particle indicates the direction “to” or “toward.” In the previous 
section however, it was noted that the direction (e.g., destination) can be 
marked by the case particle . The difference between  and  is that 
while  indicates a specific location or destination,   indicates a more 
general direction of the target location, as in the following sentences:

 “Where do (you) go?”
 “In what direction, do (you) go?”

Here are some more examples:

 “Go toward the left side”
 “Please move the sofa toward the 

TV side”
 “Run toward the front”

 “Come in the direction of the school”
 “Go out in the direction of the coffee shop”

Selection

Third, the particle indicates that the preceding noun is a selection from 
several options. For instance, consider the following sentences.

Salesman:  “In what size shall (I) give (it to 
you)?”

Customer:  . “Give (me) the small.”

9780415774871_C 12.indd   919780415774871_C12.indd   91 7/4/2008   1:38:01 PM7/4/2008   1:38:01 PM



92  Unit 12: Case particles 1

Notice that by using , the salesman implies that there are more than 
one size. Here are some more examples:

Server:  “As for desert, what would 
(you) like?”

Customer 1: . “As for me, give 
(me) the vanilla ice cream.”

Customer 2: . “As for me, give (me) the 
cheese cake.”

The change of state

Fourth, the particle indicates “the change of state.” For instance, consider 
the following sentences:

“Peter was elected as the president”
 “Samsung grew up into a big company”

 “Water changed into ice”

Notice that in the examples above, the particle ( )  marks the result 
of the change.

Reasons

Fifth, the particle indicates “the reason.” Consider the following examples.

 “As for us, (we) rejoiced 
because of the school baseball team’s victory”

 “(I) got hurt in the leg due to the car 
accident”

   “Seoul became well known 
due to the 1988 Olympics”

 “Egypt is well known because of the 
Pyramids”

UNIT 13
Case particles 2 

 0i,  e,  wa/  kwa,  irang, 
and  hago

The case particle 

The case particle  indicates the possessor and possession relationship 
between two nouns, as in  “James’ room.” The first noun is 
typically the possessor (since it is attached by the particle), and the second 
noun is the possession. The case particle  is a one-form particle. It is 
the same regardless of whether it attaches to a noun that ends in a vowel 
or a consonant, as in  “Susan’s bag” and  “Tony’s 
wallet.”

The first person possessive pronoun  (plain form) and  (humble 
form) are combinations of the first person pronouns and the particle:

 “I (plain)” +  =  “my (plain)”
 “I (humble)” +  =  “my (humble)”

 “As for that, (it) is my sneaker”
 “As for Thomas, (he) is my friend”

In a similar manner, the question word  “whose” is the combina-
tion of the question word  “who” and the particle , as in 

? “As for this, whose letter is (this)?”
As seen above, the function of the particle  resembles that of the 

English suffix -’s. However, there is one clear difference in their usages. 
English allows the possessor + ’s construction, as in “Steven’s” or “Andy’s.” 
However, Korean does not allow the possessor noun ending with the 
particle. Consequently, a sentence like  “As for 
that computer, (it) is Steven’s” is unacceptable. For this purpose, a bound 
noun  “thing” typically appears after the particle, as in 

  “As for that computer, (it) is Steven’s (thing).”
In colloquial and informal usages, the particle  can be often omitted. 

For instance,   can be used instead of  “Susan’s bag” 
and  (or  for a more colloquial usage) can be used 
instead of  “Steven’s (thing).”

9780415774871_C 13.indd   999780415774871_C13.indd   99 7/4/2008   1:37:12 PM7/4/2008   1:37:12 PM



100  Unit 13: Case particles 2

In summary, there are three ways to express a possessor–possession 
relationship in Korean:

1 noun  noun, as in  “Daniel’s wallet.”
2 noun noun, as in  “Daniel wallet.”
3 noun  (or ), as in  “Daniel thing.”

The particle 

The case particle  is a one-form particle that expresses four things: (1) 
the static location, (2) the goal of the action (e.g., destination), (3) times, 
and (4) quantity.

First, the particle marks the static location, corresponding to “in,” 
“at” or “on” in English. The static location refers to the place where some-
thing is (being), at or in. For instance, consider the following sentence:

 “Susan is at home”

The home  is a static location, where Susan is. Here are more examples.

 “The computer is at the library”
 “John is at the airport”
 “(I) place a book on the desk”

 “The Vatican is in Rome”
 “The Amazon River is in Brazil”

Notice that all the location nouns above (e.g., , , ) are 
marked by the particle , since they are all static locations.

Second, the particle expresses the goal of the action (e.g., inanimate 
objects or destinations), corresponding to “to” or “at’ in English. Consider 
the following sentences:

 “Please send the money to the bank”
 “(I) contacted the police station”
 “(I) paid taxes to the government”

 “(I) make a phone call to school”
 “(I) go to Chicago tomorrow”

 “(They) come to Korea”
   “The plane arrives at JFK airport 

today”

Notice that the goals of the actions marked by the particle  are all 
inanimate objects (e.g., , , , ). In addition, when the 

9780415774871_C 13.indd   1009780415774871_C13.indd   100 7/4/2008   1:37:13 PM7/4/2008   1:37:13 PM



 Unit 13: Case particles 2  101

particle is used with motion verbs like  “go,”  “come,” and 
 “arrive,” the particle indicates a destination (e.g., , , ).
If the goal of the action is animate, the different particles, such as  

and , are used.

“(I) make a phone call to Thomas”
 (O)

 (X)

“(I) gave the book to Peter”
 (O)

 (X)

“(I) talked to the friend”
 (O)

 (X)

Third, the particle  marks the time noun, corresponding to “at,” “in,” 
or “on” in English.

    “(I) watch TV at 10:00 a.m.”
 “(Let us) meet on Tuesday”

 “(I am) busy in the afternoon”

One should be careful not to use the particle with all time nouns, since 
certain time nouns, such as  “yesterday,”  “today,” and  
“tomorrow,” do not take the particle . Consequently, a sentence like 

 “(Let us) meet at Starbucks tomorrow” is 
unacceptable due to the use of particle .

Lastly, the particle  is used to mean “for” or “per,” as in “per day.”

 “How many hours do (you) watch TV 
per day?”

 “How much is (it) per box?”
 “As for that wine, how much is (it) per 

bottle?”

The particle , , and 

The case particles , , and  mean “and.” Their primary func-
tion is to link nouns together. First, let us discuss the particle . The 
particle  is a two-form particle.  is used with the noun that ends 
in a vowel (e.g.,  “Thomas and Daniel”), and  is used 
with the noun that ends in a consonant (e.g.,  “Daniel 

9780415774871_C 13.indd   1019780415774871_C13.indd   101 7/4/2008   1:37:13 PM7/4/2008   1:37:13 PM



102  Unit 13: Case particles 2

and Thomas”). The particle  tends to be used in formal or written 
communication.

 “Susan and Thomas are 
Americans”

 “Youngmee and Jaeho are Koreans”
 “My older brother and older sister 

live in Boston”
 “Korea and Japan are in East 

Asia”
 “Madrid and Barcelona 

are in Spain”

The particle ( )  tends to be used for more informal and/or colloquial 
settings. The particle ( )  is also a two-form particle.  is used with 
a noun that ends in a consonant, and  is used with a noun that ends in 
a vowel.

 “Susan and Thomas are 
Americans”

 “Yua and Youngho are Koreans”

The particle  is a one-form particle that comes after a noun regard-
less of whether it ends in a vowel or a consonant. There is no apparent 
meaning difference between  and the other two particles  and 

. However,  seems to be less informal than  but more 
formal than .

 “Thomas and Susan are 
Americans”

 “Jaeho and Soomee are Koreans”
 “Write the address and the home 

phone number”
 “(I) will travel to Paris and London”

 “(I) ordered steak and wine”

When the subject is understood from the context, it can be omitted. In 
such cases, the noun with , , or  can stand alone, as in 

  “(Susan) drinks coffee with Thomas.” 
Then, the translation of the particles is “with” rather than “and.”

UNIT 14
Case particles 3 

 es9,  ege,  hant’e,  kke, 
 eges9, and  hant’es9

The particle 

The case particle is a one-form particle and is used to express two 
things: (1) the dynamic location, or (2) the source of action. A dynamic 
location refers to the place where an action takes place. Consider the 
following sentence:

 “John eats lunch at the school 
cafeteria”

Notice that “the school cafeteria” is a dynamic location, where 
the action (e.g., eating lunch) takes place. In fact, the use of the particle 

 is determined by the type of verb the sentence has. Whenever the 
verb denotes an activity such as playing, doing, meeting, working, studying, 
and so forth,  must be used. Here are more examples:

 “Andrew meets Susan at school”
  “Andrew meets Susan at school”

In the first sentence above, the particle  is used, since the school is the 
dynamic location where the action (e.g., meeting Susan) is taking place. 
The use of  in this context would be ungrammatical.

Second, the particle  marks a source of action (e.g., starting location), 
corresponding to “from” in English. Consider the following examples:

 “(I) go to New York City from Boston”
 “Please clean from here to there”

 “Naoko comes from Japan”

Notice that the sources of action above are all inanimate entities (e.g., 
places such as Boston, here, and Japan). If the sources of actions are 
animate such as persons and animals, different particles such as  or 

 should be used.

9780415774871_C 14.indd   1099780415774871_C14.indd   109 7/4/2008   1:37:28 PM7/4/2008   1:37:28 PM



110  Unit 14: Case particles 3

The particles 

The case particles , , and  are one-form particles that mark 
the animate indirect object of the sentence, corresponding with “to” in 
English.

The particle 

The particle  is most widely used in colloquial settings.

 “(I) talk to father”
 “(I) made a phone call to my friend”

 “(I) contact Gina”
 “(I) gave books to Eugene”

 “(I) gave milk to the puppy”

Notice that the indirect objects are all animate objects (e.g., person, 
animals). As previously noted, the particle  is used if the indirect objects 
are inanimate objects (e.g., destinations).

 “(I) make a phone call to the company”
 “(I) pay tuition to school”

 “(I) go to Korea”

The particle 

The particle  is used instead of  in more formal usage (e.g., 
written communication).

 “(I) sent this letter to James”

Notice that the sentence above sounds formal, since the particle  as 
well as the deferential speech level ending  are used.

The particle 

When the indirect object is an the esteemed person or senior, such as one’s 
boss, teachers, and parents, the particle  can be optionally used instead 
of or . The particle  is another indirect object particle, used to 
indicate honorific meanings to the esteemed indirect object. For instance, 
consider the following sentences:

 “(I) gave a bag to the teacher”
 “(I) gave a bag to the president”

9780415774871_C 14.indd   1109780415774871_C14.indd   110 7/4/2008   1:37:28 PM7/4/2008   1:37:28 PM



 Unit 14: Case particles 3  111

In these examples above, the indirect objects are the teacher and the 
president to whom the speaker wishes to express honorific attitude. 
Consequently, the use of the particle  is more appropriate than the use 
of  or .

One thing to remember when using , is that since it is an honorific 
element its usage should be collocated with other honorific elements such 
as the honorific suffix, euphemistic words, proper address or reference terms 
and so on. For example, in the above examples,  “give (honorific)” 
is used instead of “give (plain form).”

The particles  and 

The case particles  and  are both one-form particles. These 
particles mark an animate source, corresponding to “from” in English. The 
only difference between  and  is that the former is used in 
colloquial settings whereas the latter is used for a more formal context. 
For instance, consider the following sentences:

 “(I) received the book from Tony”
 “(I) wait for a phone call from 

Frank”

 “(I) received the bag as a present 
from John”

 “(I) wait for the letter from Emily”

UNIT 15
Special particles 1 

 to and  man

In the previous units, the case particles, such as 
, and  

were discussed. The only special particle introduced so far is the topic 
particle . This unit discusses the difference between the case and 
special particles in their functions as well as the place where they appear. 
Then, the unit introduces two special particles,  and .

The differences between case particles and 
special particles

What distinguishes case particles from special particles lies in their func-
tions. While the primary function of the case particle is to indicate the 
syntactic role of the noun it attaches to (e.g., whether the noun is the 
subject, object, indirect object, and so on), that of the special particle is 
to add a special meaning such as “also,” “even,” and “only,” or to indicate 
whether the word it attaches to is the topic of the sentence.

Case particles also differ from special particles in the place they appear 
in the sentence. A case particle can appear only after a noun (e.g., subject, 
object, indirect objects etc.). However, a special particle can appear in 
one of three places. First, it can appear in place of a case particle. For 
instance, a special topic particle  can appear where you would expect 
the subject case particle :

 “Susan is a student”
 “As for Susan, (she) is a student”

 “Today’s weather is good”
 “As for today’s weather, (it) is good”

They can also appear in the place where you would expect the object case 
particle :

9780415774871_C 15.indd   1179780415774871_C15.indd   117 7/4/2008   1:36:54 PM7/4/2008   1:36:54 PM



118  Unit 15: Special particles 1

 “Michael learns golf”
 “As for golf, Michael learns (it)”

 “Susan likes spaghetti”
 “As for spaghetti, she likes (it)”

Second, a special particle can appear after an existing case particle, such 
as , , and , in order to add the special meaning.

 “Brian sleeps in the living room”
 “As for the living room, Brian sleeps 

(there)”

Third, a special particle can appear not only after a noun but also after an 
adverb, such as  “fast” and “cheaply; at a low price.”

 “That restaurant serves the food fast”
 “(I don’t know about other things but) 

that restaurant serves the food fast”

 “That store sells fruit at cheap prices”
 “(I don’t know about other things 

but) that store sells fruit at a low price”

Consequently, one cannot simply memorize where a certain particle (includ-
ing both case and special particles) always appears in a certain context. 
This is because, as seen above, a particle can appear in the place where 
you would expect the other particle to be.

The special particle 

The one-form special particle  adds the meaning of “only” or “just” on 
the noun it attaches to. The special particle  can appear in place of the 
case particles  or .

 “Naoko drinks coffee”
 “Only Naoko drinks coffee”
 “Naoko drinks only coffee”

 “Simon studies Korean”
 “Only Simon studies Korean”
 “Simon studies only Korean”

The particle  can also be attached to an existing case particle, such as 
 and .

9780415774871_C 15.indd   1189780415774871_C15.indd   118 7/4/2008   1:36:54 PM7/4/2008   1:36:54 PM



 Unit 15: Special particles 1  119

 “As for Angie, (she) goes to school 
only on Monday”

 “As for Angie, (she) goes only to 
school on Monday”

 “As for Joyce, (she) studies at the 
library”

 “As for Joyce, (she) studies only at 
the library”

The particle  “only” can also appear after an adverb, such as  
“deliciously” and  “fast.”

 “Please cook (it) deliciously”
 “Please just cook (it) deliciously”

 “Come in hurry”
 “Just come in hurry”

The special particle 

The one-form special particle  adds the meaning of “also,” “too,” or 
“even” to the noun it attaches to. Just like the particle , the special 
particle  can appear in place of the case particles  or .

 “Naoko drinks coffee”
 “Naoko also drinks coffee”
 “Naoko drinks even coffee”

 “Simon studies Korean”
 “Even Simon studies Korean”
 “Simon studies Korean as well”

The particle  can also be attached to an existing case particle, such as 
 and .

 “As for Angie, (she) works on Sunday”
 “As for Angie, (she) works even on 

Sunday”

 “As for Joyce, (she) studies at the cof-
fee shop”

 “As for Joyce, (she) studies even at 
the coffee shop”

120  Unit 15: Special particles 1

The particle  can appear after an adverb as well.

 “Cook (it) deliciously”
 “Cook (it) deliciously also”

Koreans use the particle  when they list additional items. For instance, 
consider the following sentences:

 “There is some pasta at 
home. And there are some wines too”

Notice that the speaker lists “wine” as an additional item, by using the 
particle . Here is one more example:

 “On Monday, (I) do yoga. 
And (I) also swim”

Notice that the particle  also serves to add the additional activity  
“swimming” to the first activity  “yoga.”

Meanwhile, the particle  can also generate the emphatic meaning 
“even” to the noun it attaches to, as shown in the example below:

 “(They) have a big house. And 
(they) have even a building”

In negative sentences, the particle  is translated as “either.” Consider 
the following examples:

 “(I) don’t have a car. (I) don’t have a 
bicycle either”

 
“As for John, (he) is not a Canadian. As for Brian, (he) is not a Cana-
dian either”

UNIT 16
Special particles 2 

 ina,  put’9, and  kkaji

The particle 

The special particle ( )  is a two-form particle.  appears after a noun 
that ends in a consonant (e.g., ), and  appears after a noun that 
ends in a vowel (e.g., ). The particle indicates four different mean-
ings depending on the context in which it is being used: (1) “or something 
(like that),” (2) “or,” (3) “as many as,” and (4) “about.”

First, the particle ( )  means “or something (like that),” when it is 
used after a single noun. Consider the following examples.

   “(I) will watch TV or something (like that)”
  “(I) play tennis or something”

  “(Let us) play video games or something”
  “(Let us) jog or something”
  “Eat hamburgers or something”

As seen above, the particle ( )  marks the object of the sentence and 
reduces the importance of the object noun. For instance, the object being 
chosen may not be the best possible action or item for the given situation 
or there may be more choices. In addition, when the particle ( )  is 
used with certain question words such as “where,”  “what,” and 

 “who,” the particle ( )  reduces the interrogative meaning of these 
question words and generalize their meanings, as in:

 “where” becomes  “anywhere”
 “who” becomes  “whoever,” “anyone,” or “everyone”
 “what” becomes  “anything” or “whatever”

  “Where is (it) delicious?”
  “(It) is delicious anywhere”

   “As for Tiffany, who (does she) like?”
   “As for Tiffany, (she) likes anyone”

9780415774871_C 16.indd   1259780415774871_C16.indd   125 7/4/2008   1:36:40 PM7/4/2008   1:36:40 PM



126  Unit 16: Special particles 2

   “As for John, what (does he) eat?”
    “As for John, (he) eats about everything”

Second, when the particle ( )  is used between two nouns, it simply 
means “or.” Consider the following examples:

   “Give (me) apples or oranges”
    “(I) will go to the bookstore or school”

   “Give (me) coffee or green tea”

Third, when the particle ( )  is attached to an expression of quantity, the 
particle means “as many as,” “as much as” or “up to.” The particle expresses 
the speaker’s surprise that the quantity of the item is more than the 
speaker’s expectation. For example, consider the following sentences:

  “(I) drove as many as four hours”
   “(I) watch TV as many as two hours”

   “(I) received as much as 100 dollars”
     “This coffee (can) costs as much as 5 dollars”

Fourth, the particle ( )  means “about” or “approximately,” when it 
is used with certain question words, such as  “how many” and  
“how much.”

   “As for this dress, about how much did (you) 
give?”

   “About how many hours does (it) take by 
car?”

   “About how many classes do (you) take?”
  “About how many bottles will (you) buy?”

   “About how many people shall (we) invite?”

Particles  and 

The particle  “from” is used to indicate a beginning temporal point. 
Consider the following examples:

    “(I) slept from 11 o’clock at night”
    “(I) slept at 11 o’clock at night”

    “There is a Korean language 
class from 10:00 a.m.”

     “There is a Korean language class 
at 10:00 a.m.”

 Unit 16: Special particles 2  127

We learned that the particle  can be used after the time expression as 
well. However, as seen above, while the particle  simply means “at,” the 
particle  “from” indicates a starting temporal point.

The particle  indicates an ending point, and it corresponds to “to,” 
“up to,” “until” or “as far as” in English. When the particle is used with a 
place noun, it indicates an ending location (e.g., destination), as in:

    “(It) takes three hours by car to New 
York City”

  “(It) is far to school”

When the particle is used with a temporal noun, it indicates an ending 
temporal point, as in:

   “(We) will wait until 2:00 p.m.”
    “(I) could not sleep until 6 o’clock in the 

morning”

The particles  and  are often used together to express “from [time 
expression] to [time expression].”

   “From 11:00 a.m. till 3:00 p.m.”
  “From morning till night”

 “From yesterday till tomorrow”

In a similar manner, the particles  and  frequently show up 
together to indicate “from [location] to [location].”

  “From Seoul to Tokyo”
  “From the coffee shop to the apartment”

 “From head to toe”

The particle  can be used with a non-time and/or a non-place noun, 
such as persons, clothes, and so forth. When it is used with a non-place 
or a non-time noun, the particle  means “including (even).” Consider 
the following examples:

 “Even Barbra went to Seoul”
 “(We) even drank beers yesterday”

 “(I) even bought a belt”
 “(I) even sold the computer”

 “(I) even met Thomas’ girlfriend”

UNIT 17
Past tense and double past tense marker

The past tense marker 

Since the stems of verbs and adjectives cannot be used alone, they are 
always used with endings. Korean has many different endings that convey 
much of the grammatical functions such as tense, aspects, sentence types, 
conjunctions, speech levels, and so on. The endings can be categorized into 
two types: final endings and pre-final endings, depending on where they 
appear in the verb or adjective.

Final endings include various speech level endings, such as the polite 
level -  and the deferential speech level - . Pre-final endings 
are inflectional elements that come between the stem and the final ending. 
Pre-final endings include the past tense marker  and the honorific 
suffix - . For instance, consider the following sentence:

 “Professor Kim taught the Korean 
language”

Notice the past tense marker  and the honorific suffix  appear between 
the stem  and the speech level ending - , as in  
(contracted from + + ) “taught.”

The past tense marker  is a two-form pre-final ending in that  
is used after a stem that ends in a bright vowel (e.g.,  or ), while  
is used after a stem that ends in all other vowels. The following list shows 
how the marker is placed between the stem and the polite speech level 
ending - .

Verb stem Past Polite speech level ending

 “go”   = “went” (contracted from ) 
 “come”   =  “came” (from ) 
 “see”   =  “saw” (from ) 
 “receive”   =  “received”
 “eat”   =  “ate”

9780415774871_C 17.indd   1339780415774871_C17.indd   133 7/4/2008   1:41:00 PM7/4/2008   1:41:00 PM



134  Unit 17: Past tense and double past tense marker

 “teach”   =  “taught” (from ) 
 “learn”   =  “learned”

 “copula”   =  (or ) “was/were”
 “exist/have”   =  “existed/had”
 “do”   =  “did” (irregular)

 “small”   =  “was small”
 “many”   =  “was many/much”
 “narrow”   =  “was narrow”
 “big”   =  “was big” (contracted from ) 
 “few”   =  “was few”

Note that -  is used after the past tense marker, . In addition, 
the conjugation of the verb  “do” is irregular in that the stem  
is changed to , when it is combined with the past tense marker, as in 

 “did.”
In general, the Korean past tense is similar to the English past tense in 

that they both signal the past action or situation. However, there is one 
subtle difference between them. While the English past tense primarily 
indicates something that occurred in the past, the Korean past tense indi-
cates not only something that happened in the past but also whether the 
action or event is complete or not. For example, consider the following 
sentences:

 “(I) came home” or “(I) am home” (as a result of the 
complete action of coming home)

 “(I) wore socks” or “(I) am wearing socks” (as a result 
of the complete action of wearing socks)

 “(I) wore a coat” or “(I) am wearing a coat”
 “The full moon came up” or “The full moon is up”

 “As for my father, (he) is old” or “As for 
my father, (he) became older”

Notice that the above examples all have two interpretations. The first 
interpretation simply indicates something happened in the past. The 
second interpretation expresses the completion of an action or event. 
For instance, one may be at home, since the action of coming home is 
complete. In addition, one may be wearing socks, since the action of wear-
ing socks is complete.

Double past tense marker 

In Korean, one can change a past sentence into a double past sentence by 
adding  to the existing past tense marker .

 Unit 17: Past tense and double past tense marker  135

Verb stem Past + Past Polite speech level ending

 “go”    =  “went (and no longer here)”
 “come”    =  “came (and no longer here)”
 “see”    =  “saw (long before)”
 “receive”    =  “received” (long before)”
 “eat”    =  “ate (long before)”

 “teach”    =  “taught (or used to teach)”
 “learn”    =  “learned (long before)”

 “copula”    =  (or ) “was/were”
 “exist/have”    =  “existed/had (long before)”
 “do”    =  “did (longer before)”

 “small”    =  “was small”
 “many”    =  “was many/much”
 “narrow”    =  “was narrow”
 “big”    =  “was big”
 “few”    =  “was few”

The double past tense marker  makes the past action or situation 
more remote than the regular past tense marker  does. The double past 
tense marker indicates that the past event is no longer relevant to the 
present activity or situation. In addition, it indicates that the past action or 
situation is totally complete. For instance, consider the following sentences.

 “(I) came home” or “(I) am home”
 “(I) came home” or “(I) was home (at that time and 

am no longer at home)”

 “(I) wore socks” or “(I) am wearing socks”
 “(I) wore socks” or “(I) used to wear socks”

 “(I) wore a coat” or “(I) am wearing a coat”
 “(I) wore a coat” or “(I) used to wear a coat”

 “The full moon came up” or “The full moon is up”
 “The full moon was up (back then)”

 “(I) did all the homework” or “(I) have done all the 
homework”

 “(I) did all the homework (long before)”

 “As for Daniel, (he) came home (and is still 
there)”

 “As for Daniel, (he) came home (and is no 
longer there)”

 “(I) wore a ring” or “(I) am wearing a ring”
 “(I) wore a ring (no longer wear it)” or “(I) used to 

wear a ring”

UNIT 18
Negation

Types of negative constructions

This unit discusses how to change verbs and adjectives into negatives. 
Korean has two ways of negating. The first is to use the negatives  “not” 
and  “cannot,” and the use of these negatives has the short form and the 
long form. The second is to use the auxiliary verb  “stop.”

The short form negation [  + predicate]

The negative  is an abbreviated form of  “no,” as in  “no,” 
or   “(I) am not a student.” In addition it is used for general 
negation. The negative  means “cannot” or “unable,” and it is used for 
negation where one’s volition or ability is involved.

One can make a short form negation by placing one of these negatives 
in front of the predicate, as shown below:

[  + verb]
 “do not see”
 “do not go”

 “do not eat”
 “do not drink”
 “do not learn”

[  + adjective]
 “is not narrow”
 “is not expensive”
 “is not small”

 “is not big”
 “is not high”

9780415774871_C 18.indd   1419780415774871_C18.indd   141 7/4/2008   1:40:25 PM7/4/2008   1:40:25 PM



142  Unit 18: Negation

[  + verb]
 “cannot make”

 “cannot sell”
 “cannot sleep”

 “cannot run”
 “cannot read”

Since the negative  refers to one’s ability or volition, it cannot be used 
with the adjectives which describe states or quantity. For instance, the 
following are ungrammatical in Korean:

 “expensive”  (X)
 “good”  (X)
 “small”  (X)

 “busy”  (X)
 “happy”  (X)

The short form negation is used for declarative and interrogative sentence 
types, but not for imperative and propositive sentence types. For instance, 
consider the deferential speech level that has four different endings for 
each sentence type:

Declarative  “(I) do not eat meat”
Interrogative  “Don’t (you) eat meat?”
Imperative  (X)
Propositive  (X)

Declarative  “(I) cannot drink coffee”
Interrogative  “Can’t (you) drink coffee?”
Imperative  (X)
Propositive  (X)

Meanwhile, not all verbs and adjectives can be used in the short negation 
form. Few verbs and adjectives that have corresponding negation verbs 
cannot take the short negation forms. For instance,  “know” has the 
corresponding negation verb  “do not know.” Consequently, the short 
form negations with  such as  or  are grammatically 
wrong. Other verbs that have the corresponding negation verbs include 

 “exist/have,”  “not exist/not have,” and  “delicious”/ 
 “tasteless.”

When negating compound verbs that are made of [noun + ], one 
needs to place the negative  or in front of  “do,” not the whole 
compound verb.

 Unit 18: Negation  143

 =  “(I) do not cook” (not )
 =  “(I) cannot cook” (not )

 =  “(I) do not do homework”
 =  “(I) cannot do homework”

  =  “(I) do not study”
 =  “(I) cannot study”

  =  “(I) do not exercise”
 =  “(I) cannot exercise”

  =  “(I) do not swim”
 =  “(I) cannot swim”

  = “(I) do not jog”
 =  “(I) cannot jog”

 =  “(I) do not do aerobics”
 =  “(I) cannot do aerobics”

 =  “(I) do not kiss”
 =  “(I) cannot kiss”

The long form negation -  and -

The long form negation has the following constructions:

[stem + ]  
 “Susan does not eat meat”
[stem + ]  
 “Susan cannot eat meat”

As seen above, the long form negation is created by adding  to the 
stem, which is followed by a negative auxiliary  or . Here are 
examples:

[verb stem + ]
 “do not see”
 “do not go”
 “do not eat”

 “do not drink”
 “do not learn”

[adjective stem + ]
 “is not narrow”

 “is not expensive”

9780415774871_C 18.indd   1439780415774871_C18.indd   143 7/4/2008   1:40:25 PM7/4/2008   1:40:25 PM



144  Unit 18: Negation

 “is not small”
 “is not big”
 “is not high”

[verb + ]
  “cannot make”

 “cannot sell”
 “cannot sleep”
 “cannot run”
 “cannot read”

There is no meaning difference between the long form negation and the 
short form negation. Consequently they are used interchangeably. How-
ever, the long form negation tends to be more often used in written and 
formal communication.

Meanwhile, it was noted that the negative  is not used with the 
adjectives in the short form negation, since  involves one’s ability or 
volition. However, in the long form negation  can be used with a few 
adjectives that denote one’s desire, such as  “abundant,”  
“happy,”  “healthy,” and  “competent.” When  is used 
with these adjectives, the negative  expresses a sense of disappointment 
rather than unability.

 “(It is too bad that) For that child, (he) 
was not healthy”

 “(It is too bad that) For that couple, 
(they) were not happy”

Notice that the negative  in the above sentences is not translated 
as “. . . could not” but “. . . was/were not.” In other words, the negative 

 is used like  but with an emphatic meaning (or a sense of 
disappointment).

Just like the short form negation, the long form negation is used only 
for declarative and interrogative sentence types, but not for imperative 
and propositive sentence types.

Declarative  “(I) do not eat meat”
Interrogative  “Don’t (you) eat meat?”
Imperative  (X)
Propositive  (X)

Declarative  “(I) cannot drink coffee”
Interrogative  “Can’t (you) drink coffee?”
Imperative  (X)
Propositive  (X)

9780415774871_C 18.indd   1449780415774871_C18.indd   144 7/4/2008   1:40:26 PM7/4/2008   1:40:26 PM



 Unit 18: Negation  145

To change the long form negation into the past, one needs to add the past 
tense marker  to the negative auxiliary verbs  or .

 “Susan did not eat meat”
 “Susan could not eat meat”

The negative auxiliary verb 

For imperative and propositive sentences, the negative auxiliary verb 
 is used instead.

[stem + ]
 “Don’t see that movie” or “(Let us) 

 not see that movie”
 “Don’t see that movie”

 “(Let us) not see that movie”

 “Don’t go to school” or “(Let us) 
 not go to school”

 “Don’t go to school”
 “(Let us) not go to school”

 “Don’t eat spicy food” or “(Let us) 
 not eat spicy food”

“Don’t eat spicy food”
 “(Let us) not eat spicy food”

 “Don’t drink wine” or “(Let us) not 
 drink wine”

 “Don’t drink wine”
 “(Let us) not drink wine”

Notice that the stem  changes to  (as in ) and to  (as in 
). This is due to the fact that  is a  irregular verb. In 

-irregular, the stem loses  when the stem is followed by one of the 
following consonants: , , and . The verb  is a -irregular. Con-
sequently, the stem  loses , as it is conjugated with the deferential 
imperative ending - , and -  (since the ending begins with ). 
The other -irregular verbs include the verbs like  “live,”  
“know,”  “long,” and so on.

However, with the polite speech level , the  of the -irrregular 
verb is retained. Consider the following examples:

TV  “Don’t watch TV”
 “Don’t go home”

UNIT 19
Irregular verbs

Korean predicates (e.g., verbs and adjectives) are either regular or irregular. 
The regularity of a predicate depends on whether the stem of the predicate 
is subject to variation. The predicates whose stem do not change, regardless 
of the sound of the following suffix, are called regular predicates. On the 
other hand, those predicates whose stems are subject to variation depend-
ing on the sound of the following suffix are called irregular predicates. 
This unit introduces seven irregular predicates: -irregular, -irregular, 

-irregular, -irregular, -irregular, -irregular, and -irregular.

-irregular

Some verbs whose stem end with are irregular. For instance, consider 
the verb .  of the stem  changes to  when followed by a suffix 
that begins with a vowel, as shown below:

  -  -
 “ask”  

Here are more examples of -irregulars:

  -  -
 “walk”  

 “realize”  
 “listen”  
 “load”  

Meanwhile, not all verbs that end with  are irregular. The following are 
examples of regular predicates:

9780415774871_C 19.indd   1519780415774871_C19.indd   151 7/4/2008   1:40:45 PM7/4/2008   1:40:45 PM



152  Unit 19: Irregular verbs

 -  -
 “close”  
 “receive”  
 “believe”  
 “gain”  

Notice that these -ending verbs conjugate regularly. The stems of these 
regular predicates do not undergo any change whether the ensuing suffix 
begins with a vowel or a consonant.

-irregular

The -irregular predicates are subject to the following variation:  changes 
to either  or  (for a few predicates), when the ensuing suffix begins 
with a vowel. For instance, consider how  “cold” is conjugated:  + 

 =  +  = . Here are more examples:

 -  -
 “roast”    + 
 “lie down”    + 
 “help”    + 
 “pick up”    + 

 “light”    + 
 “thankful”    + 

 “pretty”   + 
 “longed-for”    + 
 “dirty”    + 

 “hot”    + 
 “scary”    + 
 “heated”    + 

 “spicy”    + 
 “heavy”    + 
 “fearful”    + 

 “hateful”    + 
 “lovely”    + 

 “easy”    + 
 “tasteless”    + 
 “dark”    + 
 “difficult”    + 

 “beautiful”    + 
 “dizzy”    + 

 “delightful”    +

 Unit 19: Irregular verbs  153

 “cold”    + 
 “cold”    + 

Not all predicates that end with  are irregular. The followings are regular 
-ending predicates:

 -  -
 “extract”  
 “chew”  
 “carry (on the back)”  
 “wear”  
 “catch”  
 “fold”  
 “narrow”  
 “pick up”  

-irregular

Some verbs that end with  are subject to the following irregular con-
jugation:  of the stem gets deleted when followed by a suffix that 
begins with a vowel. Examples of -irregular verbs are as follows:

 -  -
 “draw”  
 “get better”  
 “swell”  
 “connect”  
 “stir”  
 “build”  

Not all predicates that end with  are irregular. The following are regular 
-ending predicates:

 -  -
 “take off”  
 “comb”  

 “take (by force)”  
 “wash”  
 “laugh”

154  Unit 19: Irregular verbs

-irregular

Some predicates that end with  are subject to the following irregular 
conjugation:  of the stem drops out when followed by a suffix that begins 
with a vowel. A number of color-related adjectives as well as demonstr-
atives fall into this group of irregular predicates, as shown below:

 -  -
 “black”  
 “yellow”  
 “red”  
 “blue”  
 “white”  

 “be that way”  
 “be how”  
 “be this way”  
 “be that way”  

Regular -ending predicates include the following:

 “insert”  
 “place”  
 “good”  

-irregular

Most Korean predicates that end with  conjugate irregularly:  of the 
stem drops out and a consonant  is added, when followed by a suffix 
that begins either  or . For instance, consider the verb  “divide.” 
Notice that  of the stem is deleted but a consonant  is inserted, when 
followed by polite speech level ending - :

 -  -
    +  =  +  = 

Here are more examples:

 -  -
 “choose”  
 “roll (over)”  
 “foster”  
 “carry”

 “pierce”  
 “flow”  

 “lazy”  
 “different”  

 “full”  
 “fast”  

 “unskillful”  

It must be noted that the irregular conjugation of -irregular happens 
only after two vowels,  and , but not with other vowels.

 -  -  -  -
 “divide”    

Not all predicates that end with  are subject to this irregular conjugation. 
The following few -ending predicates are regular:

 -  -
 “arrive at”  

 “follow”  
 “pay off”  

-irregular

All Korean predicates that end in  are subject to the following irregular 
conjugation:  drops out when the following suffix begins with one of 

, , and .

UNIT 20
Expressing desire -  -ko sip’ta and 
progressive form -  -ko itta

Expressing desire -

In English, verbs such as “want” and “wish” are used to express one’s 
desire, as in “I want to sleep” or “I wish to buy it.” In Korean, - , 
consisting of a connector -  and the auxiliary adjective , is used to 
express the first person’s desire or wish.

 “(I) want to learn Korean”
 “(I) want to see an action movie”
 “(I) want to eat Korean food”

 “(I) want to buy a digital camera”
 “(I) wish to meet the professor”

Since one cannot speak for the second person’s desire, -  cannot be 
used for a second person statement. However it can be used for second 
person questions.

 “What kind of movie do (you) want to 
see?”

 “Where do (you) like to go?”
 “What kind of sport do (you) like to 

play?”
 “What color of glasses do (you) like 

to wear?”
 “What do (you) want to eat this 

weekend?”

To indicate the third person’s wish in both statements and questions, 
-  is used:

 “Suzie wants to go to Korea”
 “Andrew wants to eat spaghetti”

9780415774871_C 20.indd   1619780415774871_C20.indd   161 7/4/2008   1:40:08 PM7/4/2008   1:40:08 PM



162  Unit 20: Expressing desire and progressive form

 “Does Jennifer want to go home?”
 “Does John want to see a Korean 

movie?”

To express past tense, the past tense marker is added to the stem of the 
auxiliary adjective .

 “(I) wanted to read a book”
 “(I) wanted to go to Korea”
 “(I) wanted to rest at home”

 “Matthew wanted to ski”
 “Cathy wanted to eat Chinese 

food”

Notice that the sentences above all have the past tense marker  attached 
to the stem of  (as in  +  +  = ) or  (as in 

 +  +  = ).
To express the honorific meaning, the honorific suffix -( )  is added 

to the stem of  (as in  +  +  = ).

 “What would (you) like to drink?”
 “Where would (you) like to go?”

 “Which car would (you) like to buy?”
 “What kind of movie would (you) like 

to see?”

One thing to remember is that -  and -  do not take 
the copula  “be.” For saying “(I) want to be a teacher,” the verb  
“become” is used instead, as in . A sentence like 

 is ungrammatical. This contrasts with English since 
sentences like “I want to be a teacher” and “I want to become a teacher” 
are both possible.

 “As for me, (I) want to become an 
engineer”

 “As for me, (I) wanted to become a 
lawyer”

 “As for Susan, (she) wants to become 
a teacher”

 “As for Peter, (he) wanted to become 
a doctor”

 Unit 20: Expressing desire and progressive form  163

Progressive form -

The progressive form is used to express an action in progress. The English 
progressive form takes a copula (“am,” “is,” and “are”) and a verb with 
“-ing,” as in “John is sleeping.” The Korean progressive form takes 
- . For instance, consider the following sentences:

 “Peter is learning Korean”
 “Marilyn is eating a pizza”
 “Thomas is seeing a movie”

 “Susan is exercising at the 
YMCA”

To express a past action that was in progress, the past tense marker  
is added to the stem of  as in,  “(I) was reading 
a book.” Here are more examples.

 “Terrence was teaching English”
 “Jessica was singing a song”

 “Charles was listening to the radio”
 “Susan was sleeping in the living 

room”

To express respect to the subject, the verb  -  is used 
instead of  - .

 “The professor is making a phone call”
 “The president is meeting the guest”

 “Mother is making a cake”
 “The section chief is washing his hands”

To negate a progressive form, one can use either a short form negation 
or a long form negation. For example,  “(They) 
are opening the store door” can be negated both in the short and long 
form:

short form negation [  + predicate]
 “(They) are not opening the store door”

long form negation [stem + ]
 “(They) are not opening the store door”

UNIT 21
The endings -  -(0)l k9yeyo 
and -  -(0)l kkayo?

Probable future -

In English, future tense is marked by “will” or the “be going to” pattern, as 
in “I will go to Chicago,” or “I am going to eat pizza tonight.” In Korean, 
the most common way to express a future event is to use the probable 
future ending -( ) . One must remember however that this end-
ing does not express future but probable future. In Korean, an event that 
will surely happen in the future is expressed by the present tense with a 
time adverb. Consider the following three sentences:

 “(I) go to Korea”
 “(I) go to Korea tomorrow”

 “(I) will (probably) go to Korea tomorrow”

Notice that the first and the second sentences have the present tense. 
However, the second sentence differs from the first sentence in that it 
expresses the future event with the time adverb  “tomorrow.” The 
third sentence uses the probable future ending -   . Notice 
that the possibility that the future event (e.g., going to Korea) will occur 
in the future is less certain in the third sentence, when compared to the 
second sentence. In other words, -   indicates “a probable 
future event” rather than “a definite future event.”

The -   ending consists of three elements: -  +  + 
. The prospective modifier “- ” indicates “future” or “uncer-

tainty.” The bound noun  is a colloquial form of  “thing” or “fact.” 
The ending  is the polite speech level ending of the copular .

-   is a three-form ending: -   is used for the verb 
and/or adjective stem that ends in a consonant (as in   “will 
eat”), and -  is used for the verb and/or adjective stem that ends 
in a vowel (as in   “will learn”). For the -irregular verbs, 
-  is used (as in   “will live”).

170  Unit 21: The endings -  and -

A stem ending in a consonant:
 “(I) will (probably) eat spaghetti”

 “(I) will (probably) leave for Korea 
tonight”

 “(I) will (probably) receive money tomorrow”

A stem ending in a vowel:
 “(I) will (probably) see a comedy movie”

 “(I) will (probably) end (my) work early”
 “(I) will (probably) get up early tomorrow”

A stem ending in a -irregular:
 “(I) will (probably) live in an apartment”
 “(I) will (probably) make cakes”
 “(I) will (probably) sleep at a friend’s house”

The English “will” can sometimes indicate a speaker’s intention in addi-
tion to the future event, as in “I will study hard.” In a similar manner, 
-  can also indicate the intention of the speaker in addition 
to the future probability depending on the context. This is particularly 
true when the subject of the sentence is the first person. Consider the 
following examples:

 “I will also go to school tomorrow”
 “(I) will exercise everyday”
 “Surely, (I) will receive the money”

When the subject is not the first or second person, the -
ending can indicate the speaker’s conjecture. Consider the following 
examples:

 “As for tomorrow, (I guess) snow may fall”
 “(I guess) as for Susan, (she) may be 

busy tonight”
 “(I guess) as for Korea, (it) may be hot”

 “(I guess) the test may be difficult”
 “(I guess) the housing price may be expensive”

When -  is used with the copula , the ending indicates a 
probable present. For instance, consider the following sentences:

 “Erin is probably a Korean”
 “That car is probably Susan’s”
 “The destination is probably Chicago”

 Unit 21: The endings -  and -   171

Indicating a wondering mindset and/or asking 
someone’s opinion: -

The -  ending is used to indicate a speaker’s wondering mindset 
and/or to seek the listener’s opinion. To make the ending polite one can 
add  to the ending, as in -  The ending -  is a three 
form verb ending: -  is used with the stem that ends in a consonant 
as in  and  is used with the stem that ends in a vowel as in 

 With the -irregular predicates, -  is used, as in 
When the speaker is (or part of) the subject, the -  end-

ing expresses the speaker’s wondering mindset. Consider the following 
sentences.

 “(I) wonder where (I/we) should go this 
weekend”

 “(I) wonder at which theatre (I/we) should 
see (it)”

 “As for dinner, (I) wonder what (I/we) shall 
eat”

 “(I) wonder about when (I/we) should receive 
the letter”

 “As for dinner, (I) wonder what (I/we) should 
make”

 “(I) wonder at which traffic light (I/we) should 
make a turn”

Notice that the speaker is the subject of the sentence in the above ex-
amples. When the subject of the sentence is a third person, the -( ) ? 
ending is used to seek the listener’s opinion. Consider the following 
sentences:

 “Which university do you think Susan 
will go ”

 “As for this ring, do you think (it) will be 
too expensive ”

 “Do you think that Samuel will be at 
home?”

 “Do you think that (he) will believe my 
story ”

 “Where do you think John will live?”
 “Do you think that Thomas will open the 

store ”

9780415774871_C 21.indd   1719780415774871_C21.indd   171 7/4/2008   1:39:11 PM7/4/2008   1:39:11 PM



172  Unit 21: The endings -  and -

The -  ending can be used for the past tense as well. Consider 
the following sentences:

 “Do you think that Paul finally bought the 
car?”

 “Do you think that Andrew returned 
from Korea?”

The repeated use of - can be used to express alternative ques-
tions. For instance, consider the following sentences:

 “Shall (I/we) eat Korean 
food or Chinese food?”

 “Shall (I/we) see a 
comedy or romantic movie?”

 “Shall (I/we) go home or to the 
library?”

Notice that while the predicate (e.g., shall (I/we) eat . . . ) is used only once 
in English, the predicate is repeated in Korean.

Meanwhile, when -  is used with other verbs such as  
“do” and  “think,” it expresses the speaker’s provisional idea 
regarding what s/he may do, corresponding to “I am thinking of doing 
something” in English. Consider the following sentences:

. “I am also thinking of going to Korea.”
. “(I) am thinking of having dinner at 6 

o’clock.”
 . “(I) am thinking of learning 

Korean next semester.”

UNIT 22
Prenouns

Linguistic elements whose primary function is to modify the target noun 
are called “modifiers.” Modifiers in Korean include prenouns, adjectives, 
and relative clauses. The focus of this unit is on prenouns. The sole func-
tion of prenouns is to modify and/or delimit the meaning of the nouns 
that they follow.

There are four groups of prenouns in Korean. The first group of pre-
nouns are those that specifically delimit the quality or status of certain 
nouns. Consider the following example:

 “Old story”

Notice that  “old” is a prenoun that delimits the quality or status of the 
noun  “story.”

 “old” appears to be an adjective. However, prenouns differ from 
adjectives. A chief distinction between prenouns and adjectives is whether 
they are subject to morphological variations. Prenouns are nouns and they 
are not subject to any inflectional variation. On the other hand, adjectives 
are subject to variations. For example, in Korean, “a different school” 
can be written with a prenoun  “another,” or with an adjective  
“different.”

 (  “another” +  “school”)
 (  “different” +  “school”)

Notice that  is the conjugated form of  “to be different” (
 +  = ). How to change an adjective stem into a noun-modifying 

form will be discussed in detail in the intermediate Korean. Here are some 
more examples of prenouns.

 “old saying” (  “old” +  “word”)
 “old day” (  “old” +  “day”)

 “old memory” (  “old” +  “thought”)

9780415774871_C 22.indd   1779780415774871_C22.indd   177 7/4/2008   1:39:28 PM7/4/2008   1:39:28 PM



178  Unit 22: Prenouns

 “new song” (  “new” +  “song”)
 “new semester” (  “new” +  “semester”)
 “new shoes” (  “new” +  “shoes”)

 “used shoes” (  “used” +  “shoes”)
 “used cars” (  “used” +  “cars”)

 “used clothes” (  “used” +  “clothes”)

 “at the very first” (  “the very” +  “first”)
 “at the very front” (  “the very” +  “front”)

 “the highest” (  “the very” +  “top”)

 “another method” (  “another” +  “method”)
 “some other day” (  “another” +  “day”)

 “different person” (  “another” +  “person”)

 “net profit” (  “pure” +  “profit”)
 “pure wool” (  “pure” +  “wool”)

 “pure Korean style” (  “pure” +  “Korean style”)

Numbers

The second group of prenouns are numbers. Consider the following 
examples:

 “One person”
 “Two people”
 “Ten people”

 “One year old”
 “Two year old”
 “Three year old”

 “The first floor”
 “The second floor”
 “The third floor”

 “The semester one”
 “The semester two”
 “The semester three”

Notice that these numbers come before the noun (or counters) that they 
modify.

9780415774871_C 22.indd   1789780415774871_C22.indd   178 7/4/2008   1:39:28 PM7/4/2008   1:39:28 PM



 Unit 22: Prenouns  179

Demonstratives

The third group of prenouns includes demonstratives. Appearing before 
a noun that they modify, demonstratives indicate the speaker’s physical 
as well as psychological distance relative to the listener or a referent. 
English has two demonstratives “this” and “that.” However, Koreans make 
three referential locations:  “this (near the speaker),”  “that (near 
the listener),” and  “that over there (away from both the speaker and 
the listener).”

 “this friend”
 “that friend”
 “that friend (over there)”

Differing from English demonstratives, which can be used independently, 
as in “I like this,” the Korean demonstratives cannot be used alone and 
must be followed by a noun. In other words, Korean demonstratives are 
always used with nouns, as in  “this friend,”  “this book,” 
and so on.

Meanwhile, Korean has two dependent nouns that are often used 
with the demonstratives:  (or  in colloquial situations) “thing,” and 

 “place.”

 (or  for colloquial usages) “this (thing)”
 (or  for colloquial usages) “that (thing)”
 (or  for colloquial usages) “that (thing over there)”

 (or  for colloquial usages) “here”
 (or  for colloquial usages) “there”
 (or  for colloquial usages) “over there”

Since  or  are dependent nouns which cannot be used by themselves, 
they are always used with a modifier (e.g., a prenoun, or an adjective).

Question prenouns

The fourth group includes question prenouns such as  “which,” and 
 (or ) “what kind of.”

 “What kind of music (do you) like?”
 “What kind of person (do you) wish to 

meet?”
 “Which bank (do you) go to?”

9780415774871_C 22.indd   1799780415774871_C22.indd   179 7/4/2008   1:39:28 PM7/4/2008   1:39:28 PM



180  Unit 22: Prenouns

Notice that these question prenouns cannot be used by themselves, and 
they modify the nouns that they appear after.

UNIT 23
Adverbs and adverbials

The primary function of adverbs is to modify verbs and/or adjectives. 
Consider the following examples:

1 . “(I) got up early.”
2 . “Maybe, (he) will arrive tonight.”
3  “(It) is very delicious.”
4 . “The soup is a little salty.”

In 1,  “early” modifies the verb  “got up,” and  “maybe” 
modifies the verb  “will arrive” in 2. In 3,  “very” 
modifies the adjective  “delicious,” and  “little” modifies the 
adjective  “salty” in 4.

Three types of adverbs

Korean adverbs can be grouped into three types: sentential adverbs, con-
junctional adverbs, and componential adverbs. Sentential adverbs modify a 
whole sentence. Conjunctional adverbs are those that connect two different 
sentences. Componential adverbs modify a specific part of the sentence 
such as verbs or adjectives. Consider the following sentences:

“Anyway, the coffee was very hot. And (it) was expensive”

 “anyway” is a sentential adverb since it modifies the entire sen-
tence,   “the coffee was very hot.”  “very” is 
a componential adverb since it specifically modifies the adjective 

 “was hot.”  “and” is a conjunctional adverb since it connects 
two sentences.

Examples of sentential adverbs include the following:

9780415774871_C 23.indd   1839780415774871_C23.indd   183 7/4/2008   1:39:48 PM7/4/2008   1:39:48 PM



184  Unit 23: Adverbs and adverbials

 if/supposing  if
 even if  surely (not)
 perhaps  anyway

 certainly

Examples of conjunctional adverbs include:

 but  and
 therefore  so
 since it is so  by the way
 however  if so

 also  moreover
 or  or

 accordingly  in other words
 besides   moreover

There are three groups of componential adverbs depending on what kind 
of relation they modify, such as manner, temporal relations, and degree. 
First, manner adverbs express some relation of manner, for example:

 fast/early/soon  slowly
 far  shortly/nearly
 very/exceedingly  the first
 most  quite/very (much)
 too much  well/often

 alone  together
 much  diligently

 at peace

Time adverbs that concern temporal relations include the following:

 just at the moment  right now
 long ago  some time ago
 yet/still  already

 recently  now
 present  later
 tomorrow  the day after tomorrow

 suddenly  immediately
 for a while  night and day

 all the time  finally
 at last  ahead
 all the time  early

 always  at all times
 usually  sometimes

9780415774871_C 23.indd   1849780415774871_C23.indd   184 7/4/2008   1:39:48 PM7/4/2008   1:39:48 PM



 Unit 23: Adverbs and adverbials  185

Degree adverbs include the following:

 really  a bit
 mainly  so much
 very

However, when there is more than one componential adverb in a sentence, 
the adverbs tend to occur in the following sequence: time, degree, and 
manner, as shown below.

 “Steve always drinks coffee 
very much”

Notice that the first adverb is time adverb  “always,” followed by the 
degree adverb  “very,” and the manner adverb  “much.”

Adverbials

In Korean, adverbs do not take any morphological variation. Those adverbs 
that take morphological variations are called “adverbial.” Consider the 
following examples:

1 . “(I) ate lunch deliciously.”
2 . “Flowers blossom beautifully.”

In 1, notice that  “deliciously” modifies the verb  “ate,” 
and  “beautifully” modifies  “blossom” in 2. However, 

 or  are not adverbs but adverbials in Korean, since they 
are the results of the morphological variations:

 “delicious” :  “deliciously” =  + 
 “beautiful” :  “beautifully” =  + 

Notice above that the adverbial form -  is attached to the adjective stems. 
In Korean, one can change an adjective into an adverbial form by attaching 

 to an adjective stem. Here are some more examples:

Adjectives Adverbials
 easy  easily
 cheap  at a low price
 big  hugely
 small  tinily
 wide  widely

UNIT 24
The endings -  -(0)l laeyo 
and - -(0)lgeyo

The -  ending “intention”

The -  ending indicates the speaker’s intention or immediate 
desire, and it corresponds to “will” or “intend to” in English. The ending 
is used only with the verbs not with the adjectives, and it is normally used 
in colloquial settings.

The -  ending is a three-form ending: -  is used after 
a stem that ends in a consonant, as in ; -  is used after a 
stem that ends in a vowel, as in ; -  is used for a -irregular, 
as in .

The -  ending is only used for the first person and the second 
person subjects. Consider the following conversation:

A:  “What will (you) order?”
B: . “(I) will (intend to) eat steak.”

As seen above, the -  ending is used in the second person ques-
tion (for the first sentence) and the first person statement (in the second 
sentence). Here are some more examples:

A:  “What will (you) drink?”
B: . “Coffee please.”

A:  “Where will (you) go?”
B: . “(I) will go to the library.”

The -  ending cannot be used for the third person subject, since 
one cannot speak for the third person’s intention. Consequently, a sentence 
like  is ungrammatical in Korean.

192  Unit 24: The endings -  and -

-  vs. -

The difference between -  and - -  is that 
while the former expresses an intention, the latter expresses a wish or 
hope. For instance, consider the following sentences:

 “(I) will (intend) to eat Sushi today”
 “(I) want to eat Sushi today”

 “(I) will (intend) to travel Korea”
 “(I) want to travel Korea”

 “(I) will (intend) to go to London”
 “(I) want to go to London”

As seen above, the sentences with the -  ending simply indicate the 
speaker’s wish. However, the sentences with the -  ending indicate 
that the speaker has already made up his/her mind and will do so.

-  vs. -

In the previous unit, the -  ending that expresses the prob-
able future as well as the first person speaker’s intention was introduced. 
-  and -  can both be used to indicate the intention 
of the first person speaker, as shown below:

 “(I) will meet (them) at the library”
 “(I) will meet (them) at the library”

The meanings of both sentences are similar, and they can be used interchange-
ably. However, note that the usage of -  is much wider than 
that of - , in that -  can be used for the third person 
subject as well. When the speaker is not the first or second person, -

 indicates the speaker’s conjecture (refer to Unit 21 for review).

The -  ending “willingness”

The -  ending indicates the speaker’s promise or willingness to 
do something for the listener’s interest. The ending is used only for first 
person subject and only with the verbs not with the adjectives. Consider 
the following sentences:

A:  “What time will (you) come to the 
library?”

B: . “(I) will (promise to) go (there) by 9 a.m.”

9780415774871_C 24.indd   1929780415774871_C24.indd   192 7/4/2008   1:42:28 PM7/4/2008   1:42:28 PM



 Unit 24: The endings -  and -   193

Notice that speaker A asks what time B will come to the library. Speaker 
B’s reply with  conveys a sense of promise or reassuring of 
“arriving at the library by 9 a.m.” for speaker A’s sake.

The -  ending is a three form ending: -  is used after a 
stem that ends in a consonant, as in ; -  is used after a stem 
that ends in a vowel, as in ; -  is used for -irregular verbs, as 
in  or .

The -  ending and the -  ending seem to resemble 
each other since they can both be translated as “will” in English. However, 
there are two clear differences. First, while -  can be used for 
a second person in questions, -  cannot. This is because the 
-  ending is used only for the first person subject.

The second difference is that while -  indicates the speaker’s 
intention, -  carries the speaker’s sense of promise. Here are 
some examples for comparison.

 “(I) will (intend to) study hard”
 “(I) will (promise to) study hard”

 “What time will (you intend to) go home?”
 (X)

As -  conveys a sense of promise, it is often used when the 
speaker volunteers to do something. For instance, consider the following 
sentences.

 “I will (intend to) go to the airport”
 “I will (volunteer/promise to) go to the airport”

 “As for dinner, I will (intend to) buy (it)”
 “As for dinner, I will (volunteer/promise to) buy 

(it)”

UNIT 25
The suffixes -  -ket and -  -(0)si

Inferential and intentional suffix -

The suffix  is a pre-final ending that comes between the stem of the 
predicate and the final-ending (e.g., speech level), as in  

 +  +  “will do.” The suffix  is used to indicate two things.
First, when the subject of the predicate is the first and/or second per-

son, the suffix  expresses the speaker’s intention or asks the listener’s 
intention, and it corresponds to “will” in English. It is used for first person 
statements and/or second person questions.

 “I will go to the airport tomorrow”
 “(I) will study hard”

 “(I) will order steak”
 “(I) will come again tomorrow 

 afternoon”

? “Will (you) pay by a credit card?”
? “Where will (you) go?”

Notice that the meaning of the suffix is similar to -  “will.” 
However, while -  is normally used in colloquial usages, the suffix 

 is used for more formal usages.
Second, when the subject of the predicate is not either the first or second 

person (e.g., the third person or entity), the suffix  indicates the speaker’s 
conjecture or asks the listener’s idea regarding the topic in question. It is 
corresponding to “I guess/think” (for the first person statement) or “do 
you think that . . .” (for the second person question) in English.

 “(I guess that) tomorrow’s test will be 
 difficult”

 “(I guess that) the drama will be 
 interesting”

 “(I guess that your) legs were sore”

9780415774871_C 25.indd   1999780415774871_C25.indd   199 7/4/2008   1:42:13 PM7/4/2008   1:42:13 PM



200  Unit 25: The suffixes -  and -

 “Do you think that the school cafeteria 
coffee is delicious?”

 “Do you think that the price of oil was cheap?”

The suffix  is used in formal or broadcasting contexts, such as weather 
forecasts and news reports. Consider the following examples.

 “(I guess that) snow will fall (starting) 
from tonight”

 “(I guess that) as for tomorrow, (it) will be cold”

The subject honorific suffix -

When Koreans wish to honor the subject of the sentence (e.g., who they 
are talking to or who they are talking about), they make a predicate 
form honorific by attaching the honorific suffix -  to the stem of the 
predicate. The honorific suffix -  is a pre-final ending that comes 
between the stem of the predicate and the final ending. -  is added 
after the stem that ends in a consonant, as in   +  +  
“look for,” and  is added after a stem that ends in a vowel, as in 

  +  +  “go.”

Dictionary form Polite speech level Deferential speech level
 “go”  

 “go”   
  +  +   +  + 

 “wear”  
 “wear”  

  +  +  +  + 

Notice that although the referential meanings of the verbs  and 
 or  and  are the same, their social meanings are 

different. The presence of the honorific suffix indicates the speaker’s 
attitude toward the subject of the sentence.

Various social variables that are ascribed (e.g., age, kinship relations) 
and/or achieved (e.g., occupation, seniority, rank) determine the honorific 
suffix usage. For instance, Koreans use the honorific suffix when they talk 
to or talk about their older family members, older people in general, people 
of esteemed occupations (e.g., doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc.), senior-rank 
personnel, and so forth.

The subject being honored can be either an addressee (to whom the 
speaker is talking) or a referent (who the speaker is talking about). Consider 
the following examples:

9780415774871_C 25.indd   2009780415774871_C25.indd   200 7/4/2008   1:42:13 PM7/4/2008   1:42:13 PM



 Unit 25: The suffixes -  and -   201

1 ? “Where are (you) going, Professor?”
2 . “Professor Kim is coming.”

Notice that in 1, the subject being honored is the addressee, whereas the 
subject of 2 is the third-person referent.

The use of different speech level endings is related to who you are talk-
ing to rather than who you are talking about. In other words, the choice of 
appropriate speech levels depends on the addressee not on the referent. 
However, since the honorific suffix honors the subject of the sentence 
(e.g., either an addressee or referent), the suffix can be used with any 
other speech levels. For instance, one of the Korean speech levels used 
to address a child or childhood-friend is the intimate speech level - . 
Consider the following sentence:

? “As for (your) mother, where does (she) go?”

Notice that the speaker uses the intimate speech level but honors the 
mother by using the suffix e.g.,  =  +  + .

The following Korean verbs that have the corresponding honorific 
forms, do not take the suffix to their stems.

 “eat”  “eat (honorific)”
 “sleep”  “sleep (honorific)”
 “exist/stay”  “exist/stay (honorific)”

However, notice that the suffix  is already part of these euphemistic 
verbs.

Meanwhile, Koreans do not use the honorific suffix when the subject 
of the sentence is the speaker himself or herself. In other words, one does 
not show honor toward him/herself. Consider the following samples:

A: ? “Where are (you) going?”
B: . “(I) am going home.”

Notice that speaker A uses the suffix when asking the question to B. 
However, speaker B does not use the suffix in the reply.
